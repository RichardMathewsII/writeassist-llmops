0,2,"The essay presents several challenges that impede its effectiveness in arguing the benefits of computers. The thesis is not clearly stated, leading to confusion about the central argument. The lack of substantial evidence and logical reasoning to support the claims made further weakens the content. Additionally, the essay's organization is lacking, with a disjointed structure and abrupt transitions that make it difficult to follow the flow of ideas. The language and style are problematic, with inappropriate technical terminology and awkward sentence constructions. Common grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling and punctuation, further detract from readability. To improve, the essay should focus on articulating a clear thesis, supporting arguments with concrete data and logical reasoning, organizing ideas coherently, using precise vocabulary, and adhering to standard writing conventions.",2,"Dear Student,

Your essay demonstrates an attempt to engage with the topic of the impact of computers on society, and you have included several points to support your viewpoint. Let's work on refining and strengthening your argument to make it more compelling and effective.

### Content:
1. **Thesis Statement:** Your thesis statement is somewhat unclear. A well-defined thesis should clearly express your main argument. Consider revising it to something more precise and focused, such as: ""Computers significantly benefit modern society by providing easy access to information, facilitating communication, and enhancing productivity.""

2. **Supporting Evidence:** While you mention several benefits of computers, such as looking up information and chatting with friends and family, the support for these points is somewhat general. Strengthen your arguments by including specific examples or data to make your points more convincing. For instance, you could cite statistics on how computers have improved educational outcomes or how they aid in professional networking.

### Organization:
1. **Structure:** The structure of your essay needs clearer organization. Each paragraph should begin with a strong topic sentence that introduces the main idea of that paragraph. Ensure that each paragraph focuses on a single point, and use transitions to link your ideas smoothly. For example, start with a topic sentence like, ""One major benefit of computers is the easy access to vast amounts of information.""

2. **Flow and Coherence:** Improve the logical progression of your ideas. Ensure that each paragraph builds on the previous one, creating a cohesive argument. For example, after discussing the ease of finding information, you could transition to how this information accessibility supports education and professional development.

### Language and Style:
1. **Precision and Vocabulary:** Enhance your vocabulary to make your essay more engaging and precise. Avoid vague terms and aim for more specific language. For instance, instead of saying ""look up places,"" you could say ""access detailed geographical information and directions.""

2. **Sentence Structure:** Vary your sentence structure to maintain the reader's interest and enhance the flow of your essay. Combine short sentences with longer, more complex ones to create a rhythmic flow.

### Conventions:
1. **Grammar and Spelling:** There are several grammatical errors and spelling mistakes that need attention. For example, ""dident"" should be ""didn't,"" ""reseach"" should be ""research,"" and ""oppinion"" should be ""opinion."" Careful proofreading is essential to avoid these errors.

2. **Punctuation and Capitalization:** Ensure correct punctuation and capitalization throughout your essay. For instance, ""Dear, @ORGANIZATION1,"" should not have a comma after ""Dear,"" and ""Computers"" should not be capitalized unless it is the start of a sentence or a proper noun.

### Conclusion:
Your conclusion should succinctly summarize your main points and reinforce your thesis. It currently lacks clarity and impact. Consider revising it to effectively close your argument, such as: ""In conclusion, computers play an indispensable role in today's society by enabling access to information","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 people use computers but not every one agress that it benefits society. In my opinion, computers benefit society. There are @CAPS1 websites that can help you find information. Computers also allow people to work easily. A third reason is @CAPS1 companies are able to use them to gain business. If you are doing a project or need to look up information about something, the internet is one of the easiest ways to find that information. Google.com has so much information

TEACHER FEEDBACK: This essay presents a clear stance on the benefits of computers to society and supports the thesis with relevant examples and logical reasoning. However, the thesis could be more precise to provide a stronger foundation for the argument. The essay is well-organized, with clear transitions between points, although the topic sentences could be more defined to enhance readability. The use of language is mostly effective, but there are moments where vocabulary could be more varied and precise to convey the intended message more powerfully. Sentence structures are generally clear and varied, contributing to a smooth flow of ideas. On the other hand, the essay has several minor grammatical errors and some issues with capitalization, which slightly impede the overall readability. Strengthening the thesis statement, refining topic sentences, and correcting grammatical errors would further enhance the clarity, structure, and content of this essay.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 these days are telling kids to go outside instead of vegging out in front of a computer. Computers can but promote bad habits. I try not to use the computer unless I have too for school or to get homework. Please consider the negative effects which are exercising in apropprate content and less interaction with friends/family. Yes internets can be used to find diets and exercise plans but if you would just go to the gym to burn of those pounds everything would be just fine!

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the negative effects of computer usage, primarily focusing on issues such as lack of exercise, exposure to inappropriate content, and reduced social interactions. However, the thesis statement lacks precision and clarity, and the arguments, though supported by personal anecdotes, are not substantiated with substantial evidence or data. The logical progression of ideas is somewhat present but fragmented, impacting the overall coherence. The structure of the essay could benefit from better-defined topic sentences and smoother transitions between paragraphs. The vocabulary used is appropriate, though there are areas where word choice could be more precise to enhance the overall message. Sentence structures are varied but occasionally awkward, which disrupts the flow of the essay. Grammatical errors, incorrect spelling, and punctuation issues are present but do not severely impede readability. Overall, while the essay conveys a personal perspective on the topic, it would benefit from stronger organization, clearer thesis articulation, and more robust evidence-based support to effectively persuade the reader.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: all you have to do is make one and then you can print out one-hundred. Using computers helps society. you can easily find what you are looking for and you are able talk to anyone you want. Also, it is easy for companies to attract business. Those are only a few of the @CAPS1 reasons why computers are good for society.

More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those
who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people.
They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and
people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas.
Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and
less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. 
Write a letter to your local newspaper in which you state your opinion on the effects
computers have on people. Persuade the readers to agree with you.

•
very limited skill in using conventions. 
•
basic punctuation (including end-of-sentence punctuation) that tends to be
omitted, haphazard, or incorrect. 
•
frequent spelling errors that significantly impair readability.

TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Dear Student,

Thank you for your effort on this essay. I appreciate your enthusiasm and the points you make about the importance of computers and the internet. Here are some areas where you can improve your writing:

1. **Organization and Clarity**: Your essay needs a clear structure with an introduction, body, and conclusion. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea or point to enhance coherence.

   - **Introduction**: Start with an introductory sentence that presents the main idea of your essay. This will help set the stage for your argument.
   - **Body**: Develop each of your points in separate paragraphs, providing evidence and examples.
   - **Conclusion**: Summarize your main points and restate the importance of your argument.

2. **Grammar and Sentence Structure**: Pay attention to grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure to ensure your essay is easy to read and understand.

   - Avoid run-on sentences and sentence fragments.
   - Ensure subject-verb agreement, such as ""internet these days is very good for people"" instead of ""internet these days are very good for people.""
   - Clarify ambiguous sentences, such as ""For little world neve should get to bed at least @NUM1 pm.""

3. **Spelling and Word Choice**: Correct spelling errors and choose words that convey your ideas more precisely.

   - ""dident"" should be ""didn't.""
   - ""Reseach"" should be ""Research.""
   - ""oppinion"" should be ""opinion.""

4. **Use of Placeholders**: Replace placeholders like @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, @PERCENT1, @CAPS2, and @NUM1 with specific information. This will make your essay more concrete and less generic.

5. **Tone and Formality**: Maintain a formal tone appropriate for an academic essay.

   - Avoid conversational phrases or comments that can be perceived as informal or unclear, such as ""not trying to be mean.""

Here is a revised version of your introduction and conclusion as an example to guide you:

**Original Introduction and Conclusion**:

1,6,"The essay presents a clear stance on the issue of censoring offensive materials in libraries, but it could benefit significantly from a more structured and logical progression of ideas. The thesis is somewhat vague, and the arguments, while present, lack substantial evidence and specific examples that could strengthen the overall argument. There are instances where the writing becomes repetitive and digresses from the main point, affecting the overall coherence. The use of vocabulary is appropriate and varied, which helps in conveying the message more effectively. Sentence structures are mostly clear and varied, contributing to the readability of the essay. However, there are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that could be refined. To improve, the essay should focus on clearly defining the thesis, using concrete evidence to support arguments, and maintaining a logical flow throughout. Additionally, polishing the language and ensuring grammatical accuracy will enhance the essay's overall quality.",6,"Your essay takes a clear stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, emphasizing the potential harm of offensive materials. This is a complex and nuanced topic, and you bring forward some important considerations. Let's work on refining your argument and enhancing the overall clarity and effectiveness of your essay.

### Content:
1. **Clarity of Thesis**: Your thesis could benefit from more precision. Instead of ""I do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves,"" try to articulate the specific criteria or types of materials you think should be censored. This will help your readers understand your stance more clearly.

2. **Supporting Evidence**: Your argument would be stronger with more specific evidence. For example, mentioning specific books, movies, or examples of the content you find offensive and explaining why they are problematic would make your argument more compelling.

3. **Logical Reasoning**: While you touch on several important points, such as the potential influence of violent media on children, these points need to be expanded and supported with research or logical reasoning. For example, citing studies that demonstrate the impact of violent media on behavior would strengthen your argument.

### Organization:
1. **Structure and Flow**: Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Introduce your thesis at the beginning, followed by distinct paragraphs that each present a single point supporting your thesis. Use clear topic sentences to guide the reader through your arguments.

2. **Transitions**: The transitions between your paragraphs need to be smoother to enhance the flow of your essay. For instance, transitioning from discussing books to movies could be done with a sentence that connects the two ideas.

### Language and Style:
1. **Technical Terminology**: Use precise terminology when discussing censorship, media influence, and other key concepts. This will make your argument more authoritative.

2. **Vocabulary**: Vary your word choice to avoid repetition and make your writing more engaging. For example, instead of repeatedly saying ""offensive,"" you could use synonyms such as ""inappropriate,"" ""harmful,"" or ""disturbing.""

3. **Sentence Structure**: Aim for varied sentence structures to improve readability and maintain the reader's interest. Try to combine shorter sentences with more complex ones to create a natural flow.

### Conventions:
1. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are a few grammatical errors and typos that need attention. For example, ""@MONTH1"" and ""@CAPS1"" appear to be placeholders and should be replaced with appropriate words. Also, ""then"" should be ""than"" in ""trouble then they want to get in.""

2. **Punctuation and Capitalization**: Ensure that all punctuation and capitalization are correct. For example, ""based of"" should be ""based on,"" and ""peoples"" should be ""people's.""

### Overall:
Your essay presents a valid perspective on the issue of censorship, but it requires more precise articulation, stronger evidence, and a clearer structure to be fully persuasive. Focus","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. I believe that even if books, music, movies or magazines on the bookshelves are offense, they should still be left there. They are apart of our history and the history we're creating.     If anyone wants to read a certain book or magazine, there's a big chance they will end up reading it. There are so many ways to get to those things with the technology we have today. You could just look them up online and read them or listen to them off the

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance against the practice, advocating for the preservation of all materials regardless of their potential to offend. The central argument—that censorship is futile given technological access and potentially harmful to community dynamics—is reasonably well-articulated, though it could benefit from more specific and detailed support. The essay lacks a cohesive structure, with ideas presented in a somewhat disjointed manner. Clearer transitions and a more organized flow of arguments would enhance readability and effectiveness. The vocabulary used is appropriate and conveys the intended message, though there are some areas where more precise language could strengthen the argument. Sentence structures are varied but occasionally awkward, disrupting the overall fluidity of the text. While the essay demonstrates a good command of basic writing conventions, a few grammatical errors and inconsistencies (such as ""i've"" instead of ""I've"") need attention. Overall, the essay makes a strong case but would benefit from a more polished and systematically organized presentation.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: that could be debated about being censored.     A lot of books and movies, great ones even, contain some offensive content but they are classics. Generations, one after the other, have enjoyed them.     Now tell me, who would want to be the unreasonable person and take that away from anyone who is interested? Everyone should have the right to these books, magazines, movies, and music. Libraries should not censor them.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: With new things coming out these days, I, @PERSON1, believe that all things out in libraries should have a certain organization for certian subjects. I am not asking for any removal or destorying of books, magazines, or anything that is in the libraries but I am asking for a fair hearing of my opinion.     I would like more organization for certian things, I do know people have their own ideas about things that should be in a book. These books found in a library could bring enjoyment to people,

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear stance on the need for a more organized system in libraries to help users avoid content they may find offensive. However, the thesis lacks precision and could benefit from a more focused statement of purpose. The arguments presented are somewhat repetitive and underdeveloped, lacking substantial evidence or logical reasoning to support the proposed solution. The essay is disorganized, with ideas not flowing logically from one to the next. Transitions between paragraphs are weak, making it difficult to follow the argument. The language used is simplistic and contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors, which detract from the essay's overall effectiveness. Additionally, the sentence structures are often awkward and unclear, further impeding readability. To improve, the essay needs a clearer thesis, better-developed arguments supported by concrete evidence, a more logical organization, varied and precise word choice, and meticulous proofreading to correct language conventions.

Censorship in the Libraries 
""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken
off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then
you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books
left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, Author

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: In my opinion, I do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves. These materials @MONTH1 not be offensive to some people, but it can be to others. They can be against some peoples religion and way of life.     I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf. Now they are putting those same books in libraries. These books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them. Are these books you want your children to be reading?      There are even movies that are like those books. Many shows are based of a book series, and that series @MONTH1 not be a good one. The series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers. The kids could see something they think is really neat on the @CAPS1 and then go out and try that. They do not understand that what they do @MONTH1 not be a good thing. They could get into a lot more trouble then they want to get in.     I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all. In my opinion, the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them. After that, the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them.     There are some that would agree with my opinion and some that would not. What do you think? Do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way? Would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good? Or do you want them to know what they should and should not do?
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay. You have tackled an important and relevant topic, and your passion for the subject is evident. Here are some suggestions to help you improve your essay:

1. **Clarity and Precision**:
   - Your arguments would be stronger if you provided specific examples of the ""overly offensive materials"" you mention. This would help readers understand exactly what types of content you're referring to.

2. **Consistency**:
   - Make sure your verb tenses are consistent. For example, in the first paragraph, ""These materials @MONTH1 not be offensive"" should be ""These materials may not be offensive."" Also, in the third paragraph, ""the series @MONTH1 not be a good one"" should be ""the series may not be a good one.""

3. **Grammar and Punctuation**:
   - Be careful with grammar and punctuation. For example, ""some peoples religion"" should be ""some people's religion,"" and ""more trouble then they want to get in"" should be ""more trouble than they want to get in.""

4. **Conciseness**:
   - Try to avoid repetition. For example, the repeated phrase ""these books"" can make your sentences feel redundant. Instead, use synonyms or rephrase sentences to maintain the reader's interest.

5. **Structure**:
   - Your essay could benefit from a clearer structure. Consider using an introduction to present your main argument, body paragraphs to explore your points in detail, and a conclusion to summarize your thoughts and restate your position.

6. **Balanced Viewpoint**:
   - While it's clear you feel strongly about this issue, acknowledging counterarguments and addressing them can make your essay more balanced and persuasive. This shows that you have considered different perspectives before forming your opinion.

7. **Engagement**:
   - Posing questions to the reader can be an effective way to engage them, but try to limit the number of rhetorical questions to avoid overwhelming the reader. Instead, focus on making compelling arguments that naturally lead the reader to consider your viewpoint.

Here is a revised excerpt from your essay to illustrate some of these suggestions:

---

In my opinion, we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves. While some people might not find these materials offensive, others could be deeply affected, particularly if the content clashes with their religion or way of life. I've encountered books outside of my school library that I believe should be excluded from public libraries due to their violent and inappropriate content. These are not the kinds of books I would want children to read.

Similarly, many movies and TV shows are based on book series that may not be suitable for young audiences. These series often depict violence that can influence children and teenagers. Young viewers might imitate dangerous behaviors they see on screen without understanding the potential consequences.

While some materials labeled as offensive may not be harmful, I believe the most egregious ones should be restricted to adults. This way, parents can decide what is appropriate for their children.",0.9362357347055327,0.9000503683788283
2,10,"The essay suffers from serious deficiencies in clarity, structure, and content, making it difficult to follow and understand. The response does not answer the prompt, failing to address how the features of the setting affect the cyclist and lacking any supporting evidence from the provided text. The sentences are simple and lack complexity and technical precision, with frequent grammatical errors and limited vocabulary. The narrative is disjointed, with no logical progression or cohesive flow of ideas, making it unengaging and ineffective in delivering the intended message. Overall, the essay does not meet the criteria for well-developed content, logical organization, or proficient language use.",10,"The essay begins to touch on the critical effect of the setting on the cyclist, but it requires more depth and specificity to fully address the prompt. The thesis is present but rather vague; it needs to be more precise and robust to clearly convey the relationship between the setting and the cyclist's experience. 

To strengthen the essay, consider expanding on how the harsh conditions of the high desert, the lack of water, and the extreme heat influenced not only the cyclist's physical state but also his mental state and decision-making process. For example, you could reference specific moments from the source text where the cyclist describes the brackish water tasting like battery acid and his encounter with the ghost town, which illustrate the severity of his situation.

The organization would benefit from clearer transitions and more defined topic sentences to guide the reader through your argument. Each paragraph should start with a topic sentence that introduces the specific aspect of the setting being discussed and how it affects the cyclist.

In terms of language and style, aim for more precise vocabulary and complex sentence structures. This will enhance clarity and make your argument more compelling. Additionally, ensure that your spelling, punctuation, and capitalization are accurate to improve readability and professionalism.

Overall, the essay has the potential to meet the assignment's requirements effectively. By incorporating more substantial evidence from the text, clearly articulating your arguments, and refining your language, your essay will better demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of how the setting impacts the cyclist. Keep working on these areas, and you'll see significant improvement in your writing.","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The conditions and features of the setting caused the cyclist to be tired and dehydrated and think that he was going to die from it. For example, it says and ther growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a georgus day in June. Also , he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says I  was doing a water depleting 12 mph. sometimes life could be so creul. in conclusion, this cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay on the cyclist’s experience conveys the main idea but lacks depth and detail. The thesis is somewhat clear, but the arguments supporting it are not sufficiently developed with concrete evidence or logical reasoning. The brief quotes provided from the source text are relevant but are not adequately integrated into the essay to enhance the argument. Additionally, the essay needs a more robust conclusion that synthesizes the points discussed. The organization is basic, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, but it lacks coherent transitions and well-defined topic sentences, which makes the flow of ideas somewhat choppy. The language used is simplistic and contains several grammatical errors, such as punctuation mistakes and improper use of capitalization, which detract from the overall readability and effectiveness. To improve, the essay should incorporate more substantial evidence from the text, use precise and varied vocabulary, and ensure grammatical accuracy to enhance clarity and impact.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The cyclist ran into many issues in his/her travel to @LOCATION1. They had to dismiss many hardships such as lack of water, being lost, immense desert heat, plus minor things like snakes and road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June was the most intense hardship. That and the lack of water. Though the heat starting powing at the cyclists brain by making them see mirages, etc. The heat and entire setting made the cyclists travel much harder.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a general overview of the cyclist's hardships during their journey through the California desert, mentioning issues such as extreme heat, lack of water, and challenging terrain. While the central idea is identifiable, it lacks depth and specificity, requiring more substantial evidence and detailed examples to bolster the main points. The essay's organization is somewhat disjointed, with ideas not fully fleshed out or logically connected, leading to a lack of smooth narrative flow. Transitional phrases and topic sentences are sparse, which hampers the coherence and fluidity of the text. Furthermore, the language used is basic and occasionally imprecise, with some grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures that detract from the overall readability. Enhancing the clarity of arguments, providing more detailed examples, and polishing the language would significantly improve the effectiveness of the essay.

DOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit 
by Joe Kurmaskie 
FORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece 
of advice for the solo cyclist would be, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers 
who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” It’s not that a group of 
old guys doesn’t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid 
place. Things change. 
At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer 
evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn’t have done was 
let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice 
and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to 
Yosemite National Park. 
They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I 
would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with 
strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town.” 
This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time—say, before the last world war—but 
on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water 
supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool 
pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. 
Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, 
and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had 
been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of 
California in June. 
I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my 
strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the 
neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water 
wouldn’t cool down. It didn’t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. 
The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make 
that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so—a test of my inner spirit. 
Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was 
replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign 
jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. 
The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so 
cruel. 
I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it 
really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased 
past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. 
The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my 
shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June 
simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, 
caused me to laugh. 
It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. 
There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride 
down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d 
be fine. 
Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make 
sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst 
of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. 
In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building—abandoned years 
earlier, by the looks of it—had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A 
sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still 
be seen. 
I hung my head. 
That smoky blues tune “Summertime” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating 
brain. 
I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. 
I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you 
have left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. 
It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some 
expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and 
their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I 
was going to lose consciousness for the last time. 
Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining 
elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear 
were all behind me. 
GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP—IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE 
YOUR BEST BET! 
“And the only bet,” I remember thinking. 
As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an 
overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait—any bait, even 
though I didn’t own a rod or reel. 
An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from 
my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. 
“Where you headed in such a hurry?” 
“Yosemite,” I whispered. 
“Know the best way to get there?” 
I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group 
I’d listened to in Lodi. 
“Yes, sir! I own a very good map.” 
And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The setting affected the cyclist, because he didnt know if he was going to die or live. He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for submitting your essay. Here is some feedback that aligns with our values of clarity, detail, and expressive writing:

1. **Clarity and Detail**: Your essay has a good start by introducing the setting and its impact on the cyclist. However, it could be more detailed. For instance, instead of saying ""the setting affected the cyclist,"" you could describe how the harsh, hot environment took a toll on him both physically and mentally.

2. **Expressive Language**: Try to use more expressive language to convey the urgency and desperation the cyclist felt. Words like ""parched,"" ""scorching,"" and ""desperate"" can help paint a vivid picture for the reader.

3. **Structure and Flow**: Your essay would benefit from a smoother flow. Consider breaking it into sentences that connect more fluidly. For example, instead of ""He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry,"" you could write, ""The relentless heat had drained all his water supplies, leaving his mouth parched and his body desperate for hydration.""

4. **Emotional Impact**: Reflect more on the emotional journey of the cyclist. How did he feel as he realized he might not survive? Did he have any moments of hope or despair?

Here’s a revised version incorporating these suggestions:
""The unforgiving heat beat down on the cyclist, each mile feeling more grueling under the blazing sun. With every passing minute, his uncertainty grew—would he make it out alive? His water bottles were empty, drained by the relentless sun, leaving his mouth dry and his body screaming for relief. As the harsh reality set in, a wave of desperation washed over him, punctuated by fleeting moments of hope and overwhelming fear.""

Keep working on expanding your ideas and using descriptive language. You're on the right track, and with some more detail and expressive language, your writing will become even more engaging and powerful. Great effort!",0.9156360738581754,0.8940989331103052
3,13,"The essay ""So she did not forget to take the test again"" does not address any of the given prompts, nor does it provide relevant content or context. It lacks a clear thesis, supporting arguments, and a conclusion. The single sentence provided does not demonstrate any logical progression of ideas or evidence-based arguments. Furthermore, its language is overly simplistic and does not utilize technical terminology or complex sentence structures. The conventions of grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization are not applicable here due to the minimal content. To improve, the essay needs to directly address the prompt, develop a clear thesis, support arguments with evidence, organize ideas coherently, and employ appropriate language and technical precision.",13,"### Teacher Feedback

**Content:**

Your response to the prompt is extremely brief and does not adequately address the question asked. The statement ""So she did not forget to take the test again"" is too vague and lacking in detail. To improve your answer, you should explain why Saeng vowing to take the test again in the spring is significant to the story. Consider how this moment reflects her determination, emotional growth, or connection to her heritage. Make sure to include specific examples or details from the story to support your points.

**Prompt Adherence:**

While your response does acknowledge Saeng’s intention to retake the test, it falls short in explaining why this is an important conclusion to the story. The prompt requires a detailed explanation, including examples from the narrative to illustrate your understanding. To better adhere to the prompt, provide a comprehensive analysis that shows how this resolution ties in with the story's themes and character development.

**Organization:**

Your statement lacks the necessary structure to convey a well-reasoned argument. A clear thesis statement followed by supporting sentences would greatly enhance the readability and logical flow of your response. Begin by stating why the conclusion is significant, then provide specific examples from the text to substantiate your argument, and finally, conclude with a synthesis of your points.

**Language and Style:**

Your language is overly simplistic and does not utilize the technical terminology or varied vocabulary expected at this academic level. Aim to construct more complex sentences and use precise vocabulary that articulates your understanding of the text. 

**Conventions:**

The simplicity of your response means that grammatical errors are minimal; however, longer and more complex sentences would likely reveal areas where grammar and punctuation need attention. As you expand your response, carefully check for grammatical accuracy, correct spelling, and appropriate punctuation to ensure clarity and precision.

### Overall Recommendations:

- **Expand Your Response:** Provide a more detailed explanation of why Saeng’s vow to retake the test is crucial to understanding the story’s conclusion.
- **Use Evidence:** Support your points with specific examples and details from the text.
- **Enhance Clarity:** Start with a clear thesis, use well-defined topic sentences, and ensure smooth transitions between ideas.
- **Improve Vocabulary:** Utilize a broader range of vocabulary and technical terminology to articulate your points more effectively.
- **Check Conventions:** Pay attention to grammar, punctuation, and spelling to maintain a high standard of technical precision.

With these improvements, your essay will better reflect a well-reasoned, evidence-based argument that aligns with the expectations of this assignment. Keep striving for clarity, precision, and logical structure in your writing.","

DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus 
by Minfong Ho 
Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng
walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist
shop to see if the plant can be purchased. 
It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat
leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in
seemingly random profusion. 
“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy
potted plant by the corner. 
There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals
splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of
recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 
“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. 
A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with
vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into
the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the
bucket. 
Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,
oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had
not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. 
When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and
cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel. 
And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with
purplish petals and white centers. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced. How strange to
see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick
walls or between tiled roofs. 
And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and
found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.
“Dok Malik,” she said,
savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its
tag, “jasmine.” 
One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed
her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could
almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she
combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng
would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. 
Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm
around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed
comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? 
A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a
channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. 
And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. 
It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the
last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.
As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of
the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to
her. 
Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. “Ghup ma laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully.
“Goodness, it’s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?” Then she noticed
the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. 
Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. “Where
did you get it?” 
“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question. 
“How much?” 
For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. 
“That’s all?” Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the 
Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .” 
“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said. 
“Then what else—?” 
“Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” 
“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously. “But how could you? All the seeds for this
vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed
the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. 
“What happened?” she asked, more gently. 
“I—I failed the test,” Saeng said. 
For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the
eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. 
Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng’s hands. “It’s a beautiful
plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.” 
“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. 
“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the
words at home, lest she burst into tears again. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said. 
“I know,” her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t
as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.
That’s what matters.” 
She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her
other hand. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said. “Let’s plant it, right now.” 
She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The
soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair
trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There
was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. 
“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. 
Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and
start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?” 
“I’d love it,” Saeng said. 
Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.
She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,
the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth
watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not
even Mrs. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.
But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. 
The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.
Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng
now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange
before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: So she did not forget to take the test again.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Of course! Here is some constructive feedback for the student's essay:

---

Dear Student,

Thank you for your effort in writing this essay. Here are some points to consider for improvement:

1. **Clarity and Completeness**: Your sentence is a bit vague and leaves the reader wanting more information. Try to provide more context and details to make your writing clearer and more comprehensive. For example, who is ""she""? What test is being referred to?

2. **Grammar and Structure**: The sentence structure could be improved. It seems to be a dependent clause rather than a complete sentence. Consider revising it to form a complete thought. For example, ""She remembered to take the test this time because she set a reminder.""

3. **Engagement and Depth**: Adding more depth and engagement can make your writing more interesting. Think about including why it was important for her not to forget the test and what strategies she used to remember.

4. **Positive Framing**: Instead of focusing on the negative aspect of not forgetting, you could frame it positively. For example, ""She successfully remembered to take the test this time.""

Remember, good writing provides clear information, engages the reader, and is well-structured. Keep practicing, and you will continue to improve!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

4,14,"The essay struggles with clarity and cohesion, particularly in the initial section, where the thesis statement is vague and lacks precision. The arguments are not well-supported by specific evidence from the memoir, resulting in a weak overall content. The understanding of the text is moderate, and while there is some alignment with the prompt, the response often strays off topic. The language used contains multiple grammatical errors, including issues with spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which hinder the readability and overall quality of the essay. The vocabulary is limited and repetitive, further impacting the essay's effectiveness. In terms of organization, the essay lacks logical structure and clear transitions, making it somewhat disjointed. While there are some attempts at linking ideas, they are not consistent, leading to a narrative that is difficult to follow and less engaging for the reader. Overall, the essay requires significant improvement in clarity, content development, language accuracy, and organizational coherence to meet the outlined guidelines.",14,"The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the memoir's themes, particularly highlighting the parents' sacrifices and the author's pride and gratitude. However, there are several areas that need improvement to align more closely with the guidelines and enhance the overall quality of the essay.

**Content and Prompt Adherence:**
While you've identified some key themes, such as the parents' sacrifices and the author's gratitude, the thesis statement remains unclear. You mention multiple moods—grateful, proud—but it's important to choose the primary mood and clearly articulate it in a concise thesis statement. Additionally, your evidence should be more specific and directly tied to your points. For example, citing particular phrases or sentences from the memoir to support your claims would strengthen your argument.

**Organization:**
The structure of your essay could benefit from clearer organization. Begin with a strong thesis statement that clearly identifies the primary mood. Each paragraph should start with a topic sentence that introduces the main idea of the paragraph. Ensure that your ideas flow logically from one to the next, using smooth transitions to guide the reader.

**Language and Style:**
Your vocabulary and sentence structure are somewhat basic. To improve readability and engagement, try incorporating more varied and precise vocabulary. Additionally, work on constructing more complex sentences that still remain clear. For example, instead of ""they let people live at there house,"" you could say, ""They generously opened their home to those in need, demonstrating their unwavering hospitality.""

**Conventions:**
There are several grammatical errors throughout your essay, including issues with subject-verb agreement, verb tense, and punctuation. For instance, ""there"" should be ""their,"" and ""the didnt have much money"" should be ""they didn't have much money."" Carefully proofread your work to correct these errors, as they can distract from the overall effectiveness of your writing.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. Craft a clear and precise thesis statement at the beginning of your essay.
2. Organize your paragraphs with clear topic sentences and logical transitions.
3. Use specific examples and evidence from the memoir to support your points.
4. Enhance your vocabulary and sentence structure for better clarity and engagement.
5. Meticulously proofread your work to eliminate grammatical errors.

Overall, your essay shows an understanding of the memoir's themes, but it needs a clearer thesis, better organization, and more precise language to effectively convey your argument. Keep working on these areas to improve your writing skills and create a more compelling essay.","

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author shows many moods while writing this memoir, like gratitude, happiness, and love. The main mood in this memoir however is gratitude. @ORGANIZATION1 is very grateful for everything his parents have ever done for him and he loves them with all his heart.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the memoir's main theme of gratitude, with specific references to Narciso Rodriguez’s experiences and emotions towards his parents. The thesis is reasonably clear, focused on the idea of gratitude, and supported with relevant examples from the memoir. However, the clarity of the thesis could be enhanced with a more precise statement at the beginning. The structure of the essay shows logical progression, with well-defined paragraphs and a coherent flow of ideas, though some transitions could be smoother to enhance readability. The use of technical terminology and vocabulary is appropriate, and the sentence structures are varied and generally correct, though there are minor grammatical errors that could be refined for higher precision. The conclusion effectively synthesizes the arguments presented, reinforcing the theme of gratitude and the impact of the parents' sacrifices on the author's life. Overall, the essay is engaging and maintains the reader's interest, with good use of evidence from the memoir to support its points. To improve, the essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement, smoother transitions, and minor grammatical corrections.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created by the author in this memoir was nostalgic. @PERSON1 remembers all the happy times he had, and memories that took place in his home. In paragraph two, he reflects back on how in his traditional Cuban home, where the heart was the kitchen.

In paragraph three and four, he tells how the

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay effectively captures the nostalgic mood of the memoir through detailed reflections on the author's memories with substantial evidence drawn directly from the text. The clear and well-supported thesis regarding the nostalgic atmosphere is consistently backed by specific examples, such as the vivid descriptions of the Cuban kitchen, the familial gatherings, and the cultural solidarity in the neighborhood. The narrative flows logically from one point to the next, with each paragraph building on the previous one to create a cohesive and compelling story. Moreover, the use of technical terminology and a varied, precise vocabulary enhances the readability and depth of the essay. The sentence structures are complex yet clear, contributing to an engaging and sophisticated writing style. Additionally, the essay maintains grammatical accuracy, with minimal errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, ensuring that the content is delivered effectively. Overall, the essay demonstrates a strong alignment with the guidelines, showcasing evidence-based arguments, logical progression, and linguistic precision.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful. The author proved that it doesn't take the amount of money, or how big your house is to be happy. Sometimes its just the simple things. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The author is showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood, they still treat each other as if they were.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a general understanding of the memoir's themes, but it lacks a precise and clear thesis statement, resulting in an overall vague argument. While there are some references to specific passages in the memoir, they are not well integrated into the argument, and the connection between the evidence and the points being made is not sufficiently established. The structure of the essay is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of coherent flow from one idea to the next. Additionally, the use of language is basic, with limited vocabulary and several grammatical errors that detract from the overall readability and effectiveness of the essay. The narrative struggles to hold the reader's interest due to its repetitive nature and lack of engaging storytelling techniques. To improve, the essay should focus on developing a clear thesis, integrating evidence seamlessly into the argument, enhancing the logical flow with better transitions, and refining language use to be more varied and precise.

======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======
DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 5 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Narciso Rodriguez 
from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives 
My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a 
furnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old 
Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon 
call home. 
In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the 
Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our 
traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared 
cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking 
that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which 
I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of 
childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed 
both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. 
Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that “family” had nothing to do with 
being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, 
Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation 
prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these 
cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of 
honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their 
own kind, were clearly in need. 
Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and 
Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio 
and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not 
know my “real” grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were 
allowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and 
Rosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family 
members came and went — and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they 
were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the 
many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. 
My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the 
language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a 
better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country 
they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters 
while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were 
strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind 
of jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had 
studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, 
taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their 
children to better times drove them to endure these hard times. 
I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I’ve often told them that what 
they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I’ve often told them of 
my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I’ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in 
reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at 
such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two 
lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these 
teachings have been the basis of my life. 
It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to 
this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this 
humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not 
just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of “family.” 
And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I 
learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into 
a home.

FEEDBACK: 
","FEEDBACK:

Dear Student,

Thank you for submitting your essay. I appreciate the effort you have put into conveying the mood of the author and the story surrounding his parents’ journey from Cuba. Here are some areas of improvement along with suggestions to help you strengthen your writing:

1. **Clarity and Grammar**:
   - There are several grammatical errors in your essay. For example, ""there house"" should be ""their house,"" and ""the took any job"" should be ""they took any job.""
   - Ensure that you use proper punctuation throughout your essay. For instance, ""When the didnt have much money,"" should be ""When they didn't have much money,...""
   - It's important to maintain consistency in your verb tenses. For example, ""they had a three-bedroom apartment and they let refugees celebrate"" should be ""they had a three-bedroom apartment and let refugees celebrate.""

2. **Structure and Flow**:
   - Your essay could benefit from a more structured format with clear introductory and concluding paragraphs.
   - Consider breaking down your ideas into separate paragraphs to enhance readability. For example, you could have one paragraph discussing the parents' journey and struggles, and another discussing how they supported others.

3. **Mood and Tone**:
   - You mentioned that the mood is ""grateful,"" but you also said it is ""proud."" It would be helpful to focus on a single mood to create a more cohesive argument. You could elaborate on how the actions of the parents reflect this mood.
   - Instead of using placeholders like ""@CAPS1"", make sure to clearly describe the mood with precise language.

4. **Specificity and Detail**:
   - Provide specific examples or anecdotes to illustrate the mood more effectively. For example, describe a particular instance where the parents' kindness made a significant impact on someone’s life.
   - Explain how the parents' actions and sacrifices made the author feel proud and grateful, offering more insight into their experiences.

5. **Language and Expression**:
   - Enhance your vocabulary and expression to make your essay more engaging. For example, instead of saying ""they had their house full of love and life,"" you could say ""their home was a sanctuary brimming with love and vitality.""
   - Avoid repetitive phrases and ensure each sentence adds new information or perspective to your essay.

Here is a revised version of your introductory sentence to illustrate these improvements:

""The mood of the author is one of pride and gratitude, stemming from the remarkable resilience and kindness of his parents who left Cuba. Despite facing numerous hardships, they welcomed others into their home and tirelessly worked any job they could find to provide for their son, Narciso.""

Overall, your essay has a strong foundation, but refining these areas will greatly enhance its quality. Keep up the good work, and continue to develop your writing skills.

Best regards,

5,18,"The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the central theme of gratitude in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, providing specific excerpts from the text to support the points made about the author's appreciation for his parents. The thesis is clear, though it could be more precisely stated. The overall argument is backed by relevant evidence, but some parts of the essay repeat similar points, indicating a need for more concise and varied support. The structure of the essay is logical, with a beginning that introduces the topic, a middle that provides supporting details, and an end that reiterates the main argument. However, better use of transitional phrases and topic sentences would enhance the flow of ideas and coherence. The language used is fairly clear but contains multiple grammatical errors, including spelling mistakes and improper capitalization, which detract from the overall readability. Additionally, the vocabulary is somewhat limited and repetitive, and more precise terminology could improve clarity and engagement. Overall, while the essay shows a solid grasp of the memoir's themes and provides relevant evidence, it would benefit from more refined language and a stronger organizational structure.",18,"Thank you for your effort in analyzing the mood in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir. There are several strengths in your essay that I'd like to highlight, along with some areas for improvement.

### Strengths:

1. **Understanding of the Memoir's Theme:** You clearly identify the mood of gratitude in the memoir and provide quotes that support this mood. Your chosen passages effectively illustrate Rodriguez's feelings towards his parents.
2. **Engagement with the Text:** Your essay shows engagement with the source material, as you have selected relevant quotes from the memoir to back up your points.

### Areas for Improvement:

1. **Thesis Statement Clarity:**
   - Your thesis statement could be more precise. Instead of broadly saying, ""The mood created in the memoir is grateful,"" consider refining it to something like, ""The memoir by Narciso Rodriguez vividly portrays a mood of deep gratitude towards his parents for their sacrifices and teachings.""

2. **Integration of Evidence:**
   - While you have included relevant quotes, these need to be better integrated into your argument. For example, after each quote, provide a more detailed analysis of how it supports the mood of gratitude. Avoid phrases like ""What I mean by that is""; instead, directly connect the evidence to your argument.
   - Example: ""Rodriguez states, 'My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today.' This illustrates his gratitude for the valuable life skills and passion his parents instilled in him through their everyday actions.""

3. **Structure and Transitions:**
   - The essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Start with an introduction that presents your thesis, followed by body paragraphs that each focus on a specific aspect of the gratitude mood, and conclude with a synthesis of your main points.
   - Ensure smooth transitions between ideas to enhance readability. For instance, instead of abruptly moving from one quote to another, use linking sentences that explain how the points are related.

4. **Language and Sentence Structure:**
   - Aim for more varied and precise vocabulary. Words like ""cherish"" and ""cares"" are repeated and could be replaced with synonyms like ""values"" and ""adores"" to add variety.
   - Address grammatical issues and ensure technical precision. For instance, correct capitalization errors such as ""Parents"" should be ""parents,"" and ensure words like ""unwrittingly"" are spelled correctly (""unwittingly"").

5. **Conventions:**
   - Pay close attention to grammatical accuracy, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Errors like ""besis"" should be corrected to ""basis,"" and ensure all sentences are punctuated correctly.

### Conclusion:

Overall, your essay provides a good starting point for discussing the mood of gratitude in Rodriguez's memoir. By refining your thesis statement, integrating evidence more effectively, improving structural coherence, and enhancing language precision, you can significantly strengthen your argument and align more closely","

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful. The author proved that it doesn't take the amount of money, or how big your house is to be happy. Sometimes its just the simple things. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The author is showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood, they still treat each other as if they were.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a general understanding of the memoir's themes, but it lacks a precise and clear thesis statement, resulting in an overall vague argument. While there are some references to specific passages in the memoir, they are not well integrated into the argument, and the connection between the evidence and the points being made is not sufficiently established. The structure of the essay is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of coherent flow from one idea to the next. Additionally, the use of language is basic, with limited vocabulary and several grammatical errors that detract from the overall readability and effectiveness of the essay. The narrative struggles to hold the reader's interest due to its repetitive nature and lack of engaging storytelling techniques. To improve, the essay should focus on developing a clear thesis, integrating evidence seamlessly into the argument, enhancing the logical flow with better transitions, and refining language use to be more varied and precise.

DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 5 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Narciso Rodriguez 
from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives 
My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a 
furnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old 
Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon 
call home. 
In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the 
Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our 
traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared 
cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking 
that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which 
I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of 
childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed 
both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. 
Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that “family” had nothing to do with 
being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, 
Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation 
prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these 
cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of 
honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their 
own kind, were clearly in need. 
Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and 
Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio 
and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not 
know my “real” grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were 
allowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and 
Rosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family 
members came and went — and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they 
were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the 
many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. 
My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the 
language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a 
better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country 
they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters 
while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were 
strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind 
of jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had 
studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, 
taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their 
children to better times drove them to endure these hard times. 
I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I’ve often told them that what 
they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I’ve often told them of 
my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I’ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in 
reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at 
such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two 
lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these 
teachings have been the basis of my life. 
It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to 
this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this 
humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not 
just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of “family.” 
And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I 
learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into 
a home.

TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay. It's clear that you grasp the theme of gratitude in the memoir and have made a commendable effort to explain this through your examples. Here are some specific points of feedback to help you improve and refine your writing:

1. **Clarity and Consistency**:
   - Your opening statement is clear, but make sure to consistently capitalize proper nouns and key terms. For example, ""Parents"" should only be capitalized at the beginning of the sentence or when referring to them as specific individuals (e.g., ""my parents"" vs. ""My Parents"").
   - Be careful with spelling and grammar. ""Unwrittingly"" should be ""unwittingly,"" and ""besis"" should be ""basis.""

2. **Quotation Integration**:
   - When incorporating quotes, ensure they are seamlessly integrated into your sentences. For example, you could write: ""The author expresses his gratitude by saying, 'My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today.'""

3. **Explanation and Analysis**:
   - After presenting a quote, delve deeper into its significance. Instead of repeating the idea that he is grateful, explore how these experiences shaped his character or life choices. For instance, you could elaborate on how the love of cooking influenced his personal or professional life.

4. **Avoid Redundancy**:
   - Try not to repeat the same idea multiple times. It’s clear from your examples that the mood is grateful. Focus on providing a variety of evidence or exploring different facets of his gratitude.

5. **Structure and Flow**:
   - Organize your essay to have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. Start with an introductory sentence that states the mood and follow with body paragraphs that provide evidence and analysis. Conclude with a summary that reinforces your main points.

Here is a revised version of your essay to consider:

---

The mood created in the memoir is one of gratitude. The author reflects on his parents' influence by stating, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" This highlights his appreciation for the skills and passions they instilled in him. 

Moreover, he expresses profound gratitude and respect for their sacrifices: ""I would always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This sentiment underscores his admiration for their actions and the life lessons they imparted.

The author’s consistent acknowledgment of his parents' contributions, both in practical skills and life values, clearly establishes a mood of gratitude throughout the memoir. By cherishing these teachings, he demonstrates deep love and respect for his parents, making gratitude a central theme of his narrative.

Your essay presents a compelling and heartfelt argument about the beneficial effects of computers on society. You've done an excellent job of capturing the reader's attention with your engaging personal anecdotes and clear, focused thesis statement. Your effort to share personal experiences, such as staying in touch with a friend who moved away, adds a deep emotional connection to your writing, which is precisely what we aim for in our class.

**Thesis and Emotional Impact:**
Your thesis is clearly articulated, stating that computers have a beneficial impact on users, and you effectively support this with well-chosen examples. The personal story about maintaining a friendship despite geographical distance is particularly evocative, helping to create an emotional resonance that will likely engage your readers deeply.

**Supporting Details and Organization:**
Your essay is well-organized with a clear flow of ideas. Each paragraph effectively builds on the previous one, maintaining a logical structure that makes your argument easy to follow. Your use of specific examples, such as researching the customs of the [CAPS3 CAPS4] and accessing local news, provides strong, relevant support for your points. These details are well-suited to your audience and purpose, making your writing both credible and relatable.

**Emotional Journey and Expressiveness:**
The way you convey your personal experiences and the benefits of computers shows a genuine emotional journey, which is exactly what I encourage in this class. Your expressive language and varied sentence structures contribute to the emotional appeal of your writing. For instance, phrases like ""a convenient way to do this was by using a computer"" and describing how computers help people stay connected, add richness to your narrative.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **Transitions:** While your ideas are well-organized, some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the overall flow. For example, moving from communication benefits to educational uses of computers could be more seamless with a transitional sentence connecting the two ideas.
- **Varied Vocabulary:** While your word choice is generally effective, there are moments where varied vocabulary could further enhance your writing. Try incorporating more vivid and precise words to replace common or repetitive phrases.
- **Conventions:** There are a few minor issues with spelling and capitalization. For instance, ""infromation"" should be ""information,"" and ""coordiantion"" should be ""coordination."" Ensuring these small errors are corrected will improve the readability and professionalism of your essay.

**Conclusion:**
You conclude effectively by summarizing the main points and reiterating the benefits of computers. However, consider adding a more compelling call to action to leave a lasting impact on the reader. Maybe suggest specific ways readers can leverage computers for their own benefit, or emphasize the importance of staying informed and connected in today’s digital age.

Overall, you've made a strong case for the positive effects of computers, supported by personal anecdotes and clear, organized arguments. Your essay is emotionally resonant and engaging, and with a few refinements, it will be even more impactful. Keep","

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a mix of clear ideas and interesting reflections on the impact of computers on society, but it lacks depth and specificity in parts, making some points feel underdeveloped. The structure is fairly organized with a discernible introduction, body, and conclusion, yet the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the overall flow.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students in @NUM3 grade go on the computer each night to complete homework and to connect with friends and family? I think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. A computer can be used for communication, education, and for accessing important information quickly, such as the local news. Now, let me tell you why computers are good for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a friend who I was very close to and a part of his life. Unfortunately, he had to move away. But I still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while. A convenient way to do this was by using a computer. The computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can @CAPS5 stay in touch. Different types of communication on the computer can be e-mail, instant-messaging, video chat, online chat groups...etc. This helps people stay connected. That's why I think communication is the biggest effect on people due to the use of a computer. But, a computer can also be used for learning. At school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals. For example when my class researched different things about the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, our main source of infromation was the internet on our computers. We researched the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. Also, kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it. This is teaching them hand-eye coordiantion, and how to type. The computer is not @CAPS5 used for just communication. It's a good way to educate everyone although the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information. ""@CAPS6 and adults often check their e-mail and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy, ""says expert @PERSON1. I think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what's going on in our town, state, country, and world. For example, it can tell us about the series of shootings goiong on throughout @LOCATION1 or the many house robberies in our town. Us, @CAPS7 citizens, wnt to know everything... for us to stay safe and notified on the latest. Another example is that I logged on the computer three dats ago and it notified me about the earthquake in @LOCATION2. But there are so many benefits of a computer. The effects computers have on people are beneficial. It allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news. I think you should take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Certainly! Here is constructive feedback for the student's essay:

---

**Feedback:**

**Introduction and Overall Argument:**
- You have presented a clear argument that computers are beneficial due to their uses in communication, education, and accessing information. This is a strong thesis that sets up your essay well.

**Structure and Organization:**
- The essay is generally well-organized, with different paragraphs focusing on the specific benefits of computers. However, you could improve the flow by using clearer transitions between paragraphs. For example, starting the paragraph about education with a phrase like ""In addition to communication, computers also play a crucial role in education"" can make your writing more cohesive.

**Content and Examples:**
- Your examples, such as maintaining a friendship through computer communication and using the internet for school research, are relatable and support your points well. Including a real-life expert quote adds credibility to your argument.
- However, some parts of the essay contain placeholder text like @CAPS1, @NUM1, @PERSON1, and @LOCATION1. Ensure to replace these with actual names, numbers, and locations to strengthen your argument and make it more concrete.

**Language and Expression:**
- Your language is mostly clear and straightforward, which is good. However, pay attention to typos and misspellings. For example, ""coordiantion"" should be ""coordination,"" and ""goiong"" should be ""going."" Proofreading your essay will help catch these errors.
- There is a repetition of the phrase ""not only used for communication"" which can be rephrased for variety. Consider using synonyms or restructuring the sentence to avoid redundancy.

**Grammar and Punctuation:**
- Be mindful of grammar and punctuation errors. For instance, ""Us, @CAPS7 citizens, wnt to know everything..."" should be ""We, as citizens, want to know everything..."" 
- Check the use of capital letters (e.g., ""infromation"" should be ""information"") and ensure proper nouns are capitalized (e.g., ""earthquake in @LOCATION2"").

**Conclusion:**
- Your conclusion effectively summarizes the main points of your essay and reiterates why computers are beneficial. However, it could be more impactful by briefly restating the primary benefits mentioned in a succinct manner.

**Final Thoughts:**
- Overall, you have a strong foundation and clear ideas. With some attention to detail and refinement, your essay can be even more compelling. Keep up the good work and continue to develop your writing skills!

7,23,"The essay presents a clear and emotionally resonant thesis that argues for the continuation of current censorship practices in libraries, effectively holding the reader’s attention throughout. The development of ideas is supported by specific anecdotes and logical reasoning, although it would benefit from more vivid details to further deepen the emotional impact. The organization is strong, beginning with an engaging introduction and following through with well-structured body paragraphs that flow logically, enhancing the overall readability and emotional connection. While the word choice is generally effective and appropriate, it could be more varied and expressive to fully convey the intended emotional resonance. The sentence structures are varied and contribute to a smooth and engaging flow, making the essay easy and enjoyable to read. The essay demonstrates a strong control of conventions, with minimal grammatical errors that do not detract from the overall communication. Overall, the essay effectively combines clear organization, emotional resonance, and control of language, though there is room for further enhancement in word choice to elevate the emotional expressiveness.",23,"Your essay on library censorship reflects a thoughtful and balanced perspective, addressing a complex issue with maturity and insight. Your thesis is clear and well-articulated, effectively summarizing your stance on the current system of library censorship.

**Strengths:**
1. **Clarity and Focus:** Your argument is focused and coherent, maintaining a clear line of reasoning throughout. You successfully convey that while some degree of censorship may be necessary, the current system generally functions well to address the concerns of the majority.
2. **Personal Anecdotes and Observations:** The inclusion of your experience with your local library adds a personal touch and an element of authenticity to your argument. This not only supports your thesis but also helps readers relate to your point of view.
3. **Balanced Discussion:** You do a commendable job of presenting both sides of the argument, acknowledging the necessity of some restrictions while advocating for the overall preservation of controversial materials. This balanced approach enhances the credibility of your essay.
4. **Appropriate Vocabulary:** Your word choice is varied and appropriate, contributing to the clarity and impact of your writing. Phrases like ""extremely harmful materials"" and ""highly unlikely"" are effective in conveying the severity and likelihood of the scenarios you discuss.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Emotional Impact:** While your argument is clear, it could benefit from more emotive language and vivid examples to engage readers on a deeper emotional level. Consider incorporating more personal anecdotes or hypothetical scenarios that evoke strong emotional responses.
2. **Sentence Fluency:** Some sentences are a bit lengthy and could be broken down for better readability. For instance, ""While everyone @MONTH1 dislike a particular novel or book, libraries can not remove every book a person dislikes, as Katherine Paterson said."" could be more fluidly expressed as two sentences to maintain a smooth reading experience.
3. **Transitions and Flow:** Although your essay is well-organized, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. Using transitional phrases can help maintain the flow of ideas and make the essay more cohesive.
4. **Conventions:** Pay attention to minor grammatical errors and typos, such as ""their"" instead of ""there"" and ""offensve"" instead of ""offensive."" These small mistakes can detract from the overall professionalism of your writing.

**Specific Suggestions:**
- Consider rephrasing the sentence ""When a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it, then the book usually is taken off of the shelves."" to ""When a book becomes so controversial that the majority of people disapprove of it, it is usually removed from the shelves."" This small change enhances clarity and fluency.
- Add more emotive language to your conclusion to leave a lasting impact on the reader. For example, ""With this process, we strike a balance between preserving freedom of expression and protecting our community from harmful content.""

Overall, your essay demonstrates a well-reasoned argument with a clear structure","

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a mix of clear ideas and interesting reflections on the impact of computers on society, but it lacks depth and specificity in parts, making some points feel underdeveloped. The structure is fairly organized with a discernible introduction, body, and conclusion, yet the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the overall flow.

because of vague or imprecise language. The writing is characterized by 
•
general, vague words that fail to communicate. 
•
an extremely limited range of words. 
•
words that simply do not fit the text; they seem imprecise, inadequate, or just
plain wrong.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I believe the current way materials are censored and removed works, and should continue. While everyone @MONTH1 dislike a particular novel or book, libraries can not remove every book a person dislikes, as Katherine Paterson said. When a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it, then the book usually is taken off of the shelves.     The possibility children will see the offensve material appears unlikely. Most public libraries do not put their offensive material near the childrens books. At my local library, their is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place. To acquire these books you must have a parents permission or be @NUM1 years of age. It is very unlikely a child would ever see the materials in question.     Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated. @PERSON3 @PERSON2 @MONTH1 have had racial slurs in it, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were normal for the time. Someone can not be frustrated with a novel written @NUM2 years ago because it has something offensive in it by todays standards.     While I believe, for the most part, libraries should not censor or remove materials, there should be some restrictions set in place to keep extremely harmful materials out of libraries. For instance, libraries should not have dirty magazines or movies on their shelves. If a high majority of people want a particular material banned, then it is hard to ignore them. When a book is so vulgar people begin to protest the book, there are questions as to whether the book should remain on library shelves. When a high percentage of people join that cause, then it should be banned.     Censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today. I believe the current system in place to censor or remove books does its job, and that it should continue. If few people disapprove of a particular material, the book remains in most shelves uncensored. When a lot of people begin to protest that same material, it has a high probability of being banned. With this process, every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not removed, while the ones that truly deserve it are removed.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","**FEEDBACK:**

Thank you for your essay on the topic of censorship and the removal of materials from libraries. You've provided a clear perspective and supported your argument with specific examples and reasoning. Here are some areas for improvement and commendation:

1. **Clarity and Organization**:
   - Your essay is well-organized into paragraphs that each focus on a specific aspect of the topic. This aids readability and helps the reader follow your argument. 
   - Consider using more transitional phrases to enhance the flow between your paragraphs.

2. **Specificity and Detail**:
   - You provide a good example with your local library having a section for more offensive or obscene books. However, you could benefit from more specific examples or case studies to strengthen your argument.

3. **Language and Formality**:
   - There are a few grammatical errors and typos that need addressing. For instance, ""their is a section"" should be ""there is a section,"" and ""offensve"" should be ""offensive.""
   - The use of placeholders like ""@MONTH1"" and ""@NUM1"" should be replaced with actual months and numbers to make your essay more precise and professional.

4. **Arguments and Reasoning**:
   - Your argument that libraries should not remove materials based on the dislike of a few individuals is strong and well-explained. 
   - The point about understanding the historical context of literature containing racial slurs is pertinent. However, you might want to acknowledge the ongoing debate about how these materials should be handled in contemporary settings to show a balanced perspective.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Your conclusion effectively summarizes your stance. It reaffirms your belief in the current system while acknowledging the necessity for some level of censorship for extremely harmful materials.

6. **Technical Aspects**:
   - Ensure all names and references are correctly and fully cited if applicable. Avoid using placeholders like ""@PERSON3"" and ""@PERSON2.""

**Revised Excerpt for Improvement**:
""Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated. For instance, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee contains racial slurs, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were, unfortunately, a reflection of the era's societal norms. Someone cannot be frustrated with a novel written decades ago because it has something offensive in it by today's standards.""

Overall, you have presented a thoughtful and reasoned essay. Focus on improving your spelling and grammar, using specific examples, and considering the balance between different viewpoints to strengthen your argument further.

Keep up the good work!",0.9080870769338013,0.8870813928739174
8,25,"The essay in question struggles significantly in several areas and requires considerable improvement. The clarity of the thesis statement is lacking, which makes it difficult for the reader to grasp the main argument. The content is minimal and fails to address the prompt adequately, as it does not provide enough supporting evidence or detailed anecdotes from the memoir to make a compelling case. The structure is disjointed, with abrupt transitions between ideas that disrupt the flow and make the essay difficult to follow. Furthermore, the language used is simplistic and does not convey the emotional depth that the essay seems to aim for. There are numerous grammatical errors and issues with spelling and punctuation that further detract from the overall readability. In summary, the essay needs to focus on presenting a clear thesis, supported by specific examples and personal anecdotes, while improving both the organization and the expressiveness of the language used.",25,"Your essay touches on some of the critical features of the setting in Joe Kurmaskie's ""Rough Road Ahead,"" such as the harsh desert environment and the abandoned ghost town. These elements indeed play an essential role in shaping the cyclist's experience and emotions. However, there are several areas where your writing can improve to create a more emotionally engaging and clear narrative.

1. **Thesis Statement Clarity and Emotional Impact**: Your thesis statement, ""the feature of the setting affected the cyclist,"" is quite broad. Try to craft a more specific and emotionally impactful thesis. For example, ""The unforgiving desert and ghostly remnants of civilization in Joe Kurmaskie's 'Rough Road Ahead' evoke a profound sense of desperation and resilience in the cyclist.""

2. **Structural Organization and Flow**: The essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Consider organizing your thoughts into distinct paragraphs, each focusing on a specific aspect of the setting and its emotional impact on the cyclist. For instance, one paragraph could discuss the desert's heat and its physical toll, while another could explore the psychological effects of encountering the ghost town.

3. **Personal Anecdotes and Emotional Resonance**: To deepen the emotional connection, try to incorporate more vivid descriptions and personal reflections. For example, describe how the cyclist's dwindling hope mirrors his physical exhaustion, or how the tar-like substance from the pump symbolizes the crushing disappointment.

4. **Expressive Vocabulary and Varied Sentence Structures**: Your language tends to be repetitive and could benefit from more varied and expressive vocabulary. Instead of saying ""his hope was dwindling,"" you might say ""his hope was evaporating under the relentless desert sun."" Utilize varied sentence structures to maintain the reader's interest and enhance the emotional journey.

5. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are several grammatical errors that detract from the overall readability. For example, ""he water supply was emicated"" should be ""his water supply was depleted."" Make sure to proofread your work to correct such errors.

6. **Engaging Conclusion**: Your conclusion feels abrupt. Reflect on the broader emotional journey of the cyclist, perhaps tying it back to a personal experience or greater lesson about resilience and the human spirit.

Here's a revised version of your first few sentences to illustrate these points:

""In Joe Kurmaskie's 'Rough Road Ahead,' the harsh desert landscape and the eerie, empty ghost town profoundly impact the cyclist's physical and emotional state. Battling the searing heat of the Californian desert in June, he finds his water supply depleting rapidly, intensifying his sense of desperation. The discovery of a water pump that produces only tar-like sludge further crushes his spirits, making him question his survival and trust in others.""

By focusing on these aspects, you'll create a more compelling and emotionally resonant essay that aligns with the goals of fostering a deep emotional connection and expressive storytelling.

I look forward to seeing how you further develop and refine your essay. Keep up the","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The setting desented in the story, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summers day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the setting and its effect on the cyclist but lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The inclusion of specific examples, such as the intense heat and dehydration the cyclist experienced, provides some support to the points made. However, the response often strays from a clear focus on the emotional and physical impact of the setting on the cyclist. The language used is somewhat repetitive and lacks variety, making the reading experience less engaging. Additionally, there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as ""desented"" instead of ""deserted"" and ""sorroundings"" instead of ""surroundings,"" which detract from the overall readability. While the narrative does include some transitional phrases, the flow is disjointed, and the essay fails to maintain a strong emotional connection with the reader. Further development of the central idea and emotional resonance would improve the essay significantly.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the setting and its effect on the cyclist but lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The inclusion of specific examples, such as the intense heat and dehydration the cyclist experienced, provides some support to the points made. However, the response often strays from a clear focus on the emotional and physical impact of the setting on the cyclist.

While the narrative does include some transitional phrases, the flow is disjointed, and the essay fails to maintain a strong emotional connection with the reader. Further development of the central idea and emotional resonance would improve the essay significantly.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator is ready. The narrator tried the test once and failed. She bought herself a flower to cheer herself up. Her mother talked to her and then she felt better. She felt determined to pass the driving test just like the flower was determined to survive.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic recounting of the narrator's journey with the driving test and includes some emotional elements, such as the narrator's initial failure and their interaction with their mother. However, it falls short in terms of depth and emotional resonance. The essay lacks specific personal anecdotes and vivid emotional appeals that would make the narrative more engaging and impactful. The connection between the flower and the narrator's determination is not fully fleshed out, leaving the reader wanting more insight into the narrator's feelings and motivations. Additionally, the structure of the essay is quite simplistic, with a series of events listed without much coherence or fluid transitions, which detracts from the overall flow. The language used is basic and does not capture the emotional intensity or expressiveness expected in a high-scoring essay. While there are minimal grammatical errors, the vocabulary is limited and repetitive, which affects the overall readability and engagement. To improve, the essay should include more detailed personal stories, stronger emotional appeals, and varied, expressive language to create a more compelling narrative.

DOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit 
by Joe Kurmaskie 
FORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece 
of advice for the solo cyclist would be, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers 
who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” It’s not that a group of 
old guys doesn’t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid 
place. Things change. 
At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer 
evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn’t have done was 
let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice 
and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to 
Yosemite National Park. 
They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I 
would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with 
strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town.” 
This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time—say, before the last world war—but 
on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water 
supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool 
pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. 
Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, 
and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had 
been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of 
California in June. 
I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my 
strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the 
neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water 
wouldn’t cool down. It didn’t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. 
The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make 
that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so—a test of my inner spirit. 
Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was 
replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign 
jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. 
The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so 
cruel. 
I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it 
really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased 
past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. 
The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my 
shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June 
simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, 
caused me to laugh. 
It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. 
There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride 
down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d 
be fine. 
Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make 
sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst 
of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. 
In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building—abandoned years 
earlier, by the looks of it—had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A 
sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still 
be seen. 
I hung my head. 
That smoky blues tune “Summertime” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating 
brain. 
I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. 
I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you 
have left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. 
It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some 
expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and 
their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I 
was going to lose consciousness for the last time. 
Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining 
elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear 
were all behind me. 
GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP—IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE 
YOUR BEST BET! 
“And the only bet,” I remember thinking. 
As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an 
overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait—any bait, even 
though I didn’t own a rod or reel. 
An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from 
my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. 
“Where you headed in such a hurry?” 
“Yosemite,” I whispered. 
“Know the best way to get there?” 
I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group 
I’d listened to in Lodi. 
“Yes, sir! I own a very good map.” 
And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.

FEEDBACK: 
","FEEDBACK:

Thank you for your effort on this essay. It's clear that you have grasped the main events of ""Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie and how the setting impacts the cyclist. Here are some points to help you improve:

1. **Clarity and Detail:**
   - Your essay touches on important aspects of the setting, but it could benefit from more specific details. For example, you mention that the cyclist's water supply was ""emicated,"" but it's unclear what you mean. Perhaps you meant ""diminished"" or ""depleted."" Providing clear and precise language will help your reader better understand your points.

2. **Structure and Flow:**
   - Your essay would be stronger with a clearer structure. Start with an introduction that outlines what you will discuss. The body of the essay should then provide detailed evidence and examples from the text to support your points, and conclude with a summary. Each paragraph should have a clear main idea and support it with details.

3. **Grammar and Spelling:**
   - There are some grammatical and spelling errors that need attention. For example:
     - ""In rough raod ahead"" should be ""In 'Rough Road Ahead.'""
     - ""he water supply was emicated"" should be ""his water supply was depleted.""
     - ""He found a water pump that produced a tar like substance as a result the desert and the lack of water made him wish he was dead"" can be split into two sentences for clarity: ""He found a water pump that produced a tar-like substance. As a result, the desert and the lack of water made him wish he was dead.""

4. **Connection to the Theme:**
   - You mention how the setting affected the cyclist, but it would be beneficial to connect this more deeply to the broader themes of the story. How does the setting shape his character or influence the story's message?

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Your concluding sentence, ""That is how the feature affected the setting,"" needs to be rephrased. Instead, consider summing up how the setting influenced the cyclist's experience and the overall narrative.

Here's a revised example to guide you:

""In 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaskie, the harsh desert setting significantly affects the cyclist's journey. Traveling through the desert of California in June, his water supply quickly depletes. This scarcity of water leads him to a ghost town, where he finds a water pump that only produces a tar-like substance. These challenges cause his hope to dwindle, making him doubt the advice he received from strangers and vow to rely solely on his map in the future. The unforgiving desert setting tests his limits and shapes his resolve, illustrating the profound impact of the environment on his journey.""

Keep working on these areas, and you'll see improvement in your writing. Great effort, and I look forward to seeing your next draft!",0.8369975495172762,0.8479517721610377
9,26,"Your essay demonstrates a basic understanding of how the setting impacts the cyclist, but it could benefit from more specific and vivid details to enhance both clarity and emotional resonance. The lack of personal anecdotes and emotional appeals makes it difficult to connect with the reader on an emotional level. The structure is present but not fully developed, leading to a somewhat disjointed flow of ideas. Transitions between sentences and paragraphs could be smoother to ensure a more coherent narrative. Additionally, the language used is fairly simple and repetitive, which detracts from the overall expressiveness of the essay. More varied and emotive vocabulary would help in making the piece more engaging. Finally, while the conventions are mostly adhered to, there are minor grammatical and punctuation errors that need correction to enhance readability. Overall, focusing on adding emotionally rich content, improving narrative flow, and diversifying language will significantly improve the essay.",26,"Your essay provides a good starting point in addressing how the setting affects the cyclist, but it needs more development to fully capture the emotional and physical impact of the environment. Let's delve deeper into your points:

1. **Emotional Connection and Descriptive Language:**
   You mention that the cyclist was riding in the desert and that the towns were abandoned, but this could be expanded to create a more vivid picture. Consider describing the isolation and desolation the cyclist felt, perhaps by incorporating more evocative language and sensory details. For example, you might describe the eerie silence of the ghost towns and the oppressive heat that felt like it was suffocating the cyclist.

2. **Use of Personal Anecdotes and Specific Examples:**
   Including more specific examples from the text can help support your points. Instead of just stating that the month was June and the sun was beating down on him, you could mention how the cyclist noticed the ""wide rings of dried sweat"" on his shirt and how he could ""drop from heatstroke."" These details help the reader feel the cyclist's struggle and desperation.

3. **Emotional Impact and Thesis Statement Clarity:**
   Your thesis statement could be more emotionally impactful. Rather than simply stating the setting affected the cyclist, consider framing it in a way that highlights the emotional and physical toll on him. For example, ""The harsh desert setting, with its unrelenting heat and desolate towns, pushed the cyclist to the brink of exhaustion and despair.""

4. **Flow and Coherence:**
   To improve the flow of your essay, work on creating smoother transitions between sentences and ideas. Currently, the points feel a bit disjointed. For instance, you could connect the ideas by saying, ""As the sun beat down mercilessly, the cyclist pushed on through abandoned towns, his water supply dwindling with each passing mile.""

5. **Expressive Language and Sentence Structures:**
   Try to incorporate more varied and expressive vocabulary to enhance the emotional resonance of your writing. Instead of saying ""he was cycling with very little water,"" you might say, ""he pedaled through the scorching desert, the few precious sips of water he had left barely enough to keep him going.""

Overall, your essay shows potential, but with more detailed examples, emotional depth, and varied language, it can truly resonate with the reader. Keep working on developing your points and connecting more deeply with the emotional journey of the cyclist. You're on the right track—let's keep pushing to make your writing as compelling and impactful as it can be!","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The setting desented in the story, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summers day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the setting and its effect on the cyclist but lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The inclusion of specific examples, such as the intense heat and dehydration the cyclist experienced, provides some support to the points made. However, the response often strays from a clear focus on the emotional and physical impact of the setting on the cyclist. The language used is somewhat repetitive and lacks variety, making the reading experience less engaging. Additionally, there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as ""desented"" instead of ""deserted"" and ""sorroundings"" instead of ""surroundings,"" which detract from the overall readability. While the narrative does include some transitional phrases, the flow is disjointed, and the essay fails to maintain a strong emotional connection with the reader. Further development of the central idea and emotional resonance would improve the essay significantly.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This shows that the author is trying to focus your attention on the culture of the @CAPS1 and that the house was relaxed and calm which is the tone of the author.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay delves into the emotional and cultural elements of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, effectively highlighting the significance of Cuban culture and familial bonds. However, the clarity of your thesis statement could be enhanced to better convey the emotional impact and central theme of your analysis. While you include some personal stories and quotes from the memoir, the arguments would benefit from more in-depth development and additional supporting evidence to make a stronger emotional appeal. The organizational structure is somewhat present, but the transitions between paragraphs need to be smoother to ensure a logical flow that enhances the emotional impact. In terms of language and style, your essay shows some variety in vocabulary and sentence structures, but there are areas where word choice and expressiveness could be improved to better capture the emotional nuances of the memoir. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall readability and impact of your writing. To improve, focus on creating a more emotionally resonant thesis, developing your arguments with richer anecdotes and emotional appeals, and refining your language for greater expressiveness and grammatical accuracy.

DOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit 
by Joe Kurmaskie 
FORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece 
of advice for the solo cyclist would be, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers 
who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” It’s not that a group of 
old guys doesn’t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid 
place. Things change. 
At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer 
evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn’t have done was 
let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice 
and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to 
Yosemite National Park. 
They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I 
would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with 
strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town.” 
This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time—say, before the last world war—but 
on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water 
supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool 
pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. 
Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, 
and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had 
been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of 
California in June. 
I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my 
strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the 
neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water 
wouldn’t cool down. It didn’t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. 
The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make 
that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so—a test of my inner spirit. 
Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was 
replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign 
jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. 
The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so 
cruel. 
I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it 
really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased 
past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. 
The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my 
shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June 
simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, 
caused me to laugh. 
It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. 
There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride 
down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d 
be fine. 
Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make 
sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst 
of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. 
In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building—abandoned years 
earlier, by the looks of it—had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A 
sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still 
be seen. 
I hung my head. 
That smoky blues tune “Summertime” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating 
brain. 
I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. 
I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you 
have left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. 
It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some 
expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and 
their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I 
was going to lose consciousness for the last time. 
Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining 
elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear 
were all behind me. 
GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP—IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE 
YOUR BEST BET! 
“And the only bet,” I remember thinking. 
As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an 
overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait—any bait, even 
though I didn’t own a rod or reel. 
An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from 
my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. 
“Where you headed in such a hurry?” 
“Yosemite,” I whispered. 
“Know the best way to get there?” 
I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group 
I’d listened to in Lodi. 
“Yes, sir! I own a very good map.” 
And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he was riding in the desert and all the towns he was going to were abandoned. The month was June a hot month and the sun was beating down on him. And he was cycling with very little water.  
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","FEEDBACK:

Your essay has a clear focus on how the setting affected the cyclist, which is a great start! Here are some areas to improve to make your writing more engaging and detailed:

1. **Expand Your Ideas**: You've mentioned several key points about the setting, but they could be expanded further. Describe the desert in more detail—what does it look like, how does it make the cyclist feel? What do the abandoned towns look like, and how do they contribute to the atmosphere?

2. **Sentence Variety**: Try to vary your sentence structure to make the essay more interesting to read. Instead of starting each sentence the same way, mix it up with different sentence lengths and styles.

3. **Show, Don’t Just Tell**: Instead of just stating the facts, you can show the reader what the cyclist is experiencing. For example, instead of saying, ""The month was June, a hot month and the sun was beating down on him,"" you could write, ""In the scorching June heat, the relentless sun beat down on him, causing sweat to pour off his brow.""

4. **Details and Sensory Language**: Use sensory details to help the reader visualize and feel what the cyclist is going through. Describe the heat, the dryness, the fatigue, and any emotions the cyclist might be experiencing.

5. **Grammar and Punctuation**: Pay attention to grammar and punctuation to make your writing clear and professional. For example, ""For example, he was riding in the desert"" needs a comma after ""example,"" and ""And he was cycling with very little water"" could be revised to flow better with the previous sentence.

Here's an example of how you might revise one of your sentences with these tips in mind:

Original: ""The month was June a hot month and the sun was beating down on him.""
Revised: ""In the intense heat of June, the sun relentlessly beat down on him, each ray feeling like a flame against his skin.""

Keep up the good work and continue to develop your skills! Your attention to how the setting impacts the character is a strong foundation.",0.9432055289642896,0.9131578235884443
10,38,"The essay presents a clear and focused argument on why books should not be removed from library shelves based on individual opinions, which holds the reader's attention. However, it could benefit from better organization and clearer transitions between ideas. The essay's structure is somewhat fragmented, making it challenging to follow the writer's train of thought at times. The word choice is generally effective but lacks precision and variety in certain areas, which can detract from the overall impact. The fluency of the sentences is good, with a noticeable rhythm, although occasional awkward constructions slow down the readability. Finally, the essay demonstrates limited control of standard writing conventions, with frequent errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which impede readability. Overall, the essay offers a strong viewpoint but needs refinement in organization, word choice, and grammatical accuracy to enhance its effectiveness.",38,"Your essay addresses the topic of censorship in libraries and makes a strong argument that books, movies, magazines, and other materials should not be removed simply due to someone's negative opinion. Your main idea is clear, which is commendable. However, there are several areas where your essay could be enhanced to make your argument more compelling and your writing more polished.

Firstly, your thesis statement is strong, but it could be more precise. Instead of posing questions, try stating your stance more assertively. For example, ""Materials should not be removed from library shelves simply because some people find them offensive.""

The organization of your essay can be improved for better clarity and logical flow. Currently, the transition between your points is somewhat abrupt. Consider using transitional phrases to guide the reader smoothly from one idea to the next. For instance, after quoting Katherine Paterson, you might add, ""This highlights the importance of preserving a diverse collection of books in public libraries.""

Your use of vocabulary is generally appropriate, but there are a few imprecise or informal words. For example, ""bookselfs"" should be ""bookshelves,"" and ""corious"" should be ""curious."" Additionally, the word ""arthur"" should be corrected to ""author."" Ensuring that your vocabulary is varied and accurate will help to articulate your arguments more convincingly.

In terms of sentence fluency, aim for more varied sentence structures to maintain the reader’s interest. For example, instead of repeating ""I would"" in successive sentences, you can combine them for a smoother read: ""They either tell me it is a good novel or horrible, but after reading a few pages, I often find it quite engaging.""

Grammatically, there are several errors that need attention. For instance, ""self"" should be ""shelf,"" and ""varity"" should be ""variety."" Also, ensure that you use correct punctuation and capitalization, such as ""Considering that"" instead of ""considering that.""

Your conclusion could be more effective in summarizing your main points and reinforcing your thesis. For example, ""In conclusion, allowing individual preferences to dictate library collections would severely limit the diversity of materials available to the public. It is crucial to maintain a variety of perspectives and topics in our libraries to encourage open-mindedness and intellectual growth.""

Overall, your essay has a strong foundation, but with improved organization, refined vocabulary, varied sentence structures, and attention to grammatical accuracy, it can be even more persuasive and impactful. Keep these points in mind, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you encounter difficulties. Your effort to clearly communicate your ideas is evident, and with continued practice, your writing will become even more confident and precise.","

The word choice is often imprecise and informal, such as ""ext."" instead of ""etc."" and ""do to"" instead of ""due to."" Additionally, there are several grammatical errors, including issues with sentence structure, spelling, and punctuation, which detract from the readability and overall impact of the essay. To enhance clarity and effectiveness, ensure that each sentence is grammatically correct and that transitions between paragraphs are smooth. Lastly, refining your vocabulary and sentence structures will help to articulate your arguments more convincingly and maintain the reader's interest throughout.

Censorship in the Libraries 
""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken
off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then
you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books
left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, Author

vocabulary that may be striking and varied, but that is natural and not overdone. 
•
ordinary words used in an unusual way.

words that evoke clear images; figurative language may be used. 
Score 4: Words effectively convey the intended message. The writer employs a variety of words
that are functional and appropriate to audience and purpose. The writing is characterized by 
•
words that work but do not particularly energize the writing. 
•
expression that is functional; however, slang, if used, does not seem purposeful
and is not particularly effective. 
•
attempts at colorful language that may occasionally seem overdone. 
•
occasional overuse of technical language or jargon. 
•
rare experiments with language; however, the writing may have some fine
moments and generally avoids clichés. 
Score 3: Language lacks precision and variety, or may be inappropriate to audience and
purpose in places. The writer does not employ a variety of words, producing a sort of “generic”
paper filled with familiar words and phrases. The writing is characterized by

•
expression that seems mundane and general; slang, if used, does not seem
purposeful and is not effective. 
•

words that are accurate for the most part, although misused words may
occasionally appear; technical language or jargon may be overused or inappropriately used.

words that are colorless, flat or imprecise. 
•
monotonous repetition or overwhelming reliance on worn expressions that
repeatedly detract from the message. 
Score 1: The writing shows an extremely limited vocabulary or is so filled with misuses of words
that the meaning is obscured. Only the most general kind of message is communicated
because of vague or imprecise language. The writing is characterized by 
•
general, vague words that fail to communicate. 
•
an extremely limited range of words. 
•
words that simply do not fit the text; they seem imprecise, inadequate, or just
plain wrong.

4.
Sentence Fluency 
Score 6: The writing has an effective flow and rhythm. Sentences show a high degree of
craftsmanship, with consistently strong and varied structure that makes expressive oral reading
easy and enjoyable. The writing is characterized by

a natural, fluent sound; it glides along with one sentence flowing effortlessly into
the next. 
•
extensive variation in sentence structure, length, and beginnings that add interest
to the text. 
•
sentence structure that enhances meaning by drawing attention to key ideas or
reinforcing relationships among ideas. 
•
varied sentence patterns that create an effective combination of power and
grace. 
•
strong control over sentence structure; fragments, if used at all, work well. 
•
stylistic control; dialogue, if used, sounds natural. 
Score 5: The writing has an easy flow and rhythm. Sentences are carefully crafted, with strong
and varied structure that makes expressive oral reading easy and enjoyable. The writing is
characterized by

sentence structure that enhances meaning. 
•
control over sentence structure; fragments, if used at all, work well. 
•
stylistic control; dialogue, if used, sounds natural. 
Score 4: The writing flows; however, connections between phrases or sentences may be less
than fluid. Sentence patterns are somewhat varied, contributing to ease in oral reading. The
writing is characterized by 
•
a natural sound; the reader can move easily through the piece, although it may
lack a certain rhythm and grace. 
•
some repeated patterns of sentence structure, length, and beginnings that may
detract somewhat from overall impact. 
•
strong control over simple sentence structures, but variable control over more
complex sentences; fragments, if present, are usually effective. 
•
occasional lapses in stylistic control; dialogue, if used, sounds natural for the
most part, but may at times sound stilted or unnatural. 
Score
3:
The
writing tends to be mechanical rather than fluid. Occasional awkward
constructions may force the reader to slow down or reread. The writing is characterized by 
•
some passages that invite fluid oral reading; however, others do not. 
•
some variety in sentence structure, length, and beginnings, although the writer
falls into repetitive sentence patterns. 
5

good control over simple sentence structures, but little control over more complex
sentences; fragments, if present, may not be effective. 
•
sentences which, although functional, lack energy. 
•
lapses in stylistic control; dialogue, if used, may sound stilted or unnatural. 
•
text that is too short to demonstrate variety and control.

the reader to slow down or reread. The writing is characterized by 
•
significant portions of the text that are difficult to follow or read aloud. 
•
sentence
patterns
that
are
monotonous
(e.g.,
subject-verb
or
subject-verb-object).

•        confusing word order that is often jarring and irregular. 
•        sentence structure that frequently obscures meaning. 
•        sentences that are disjointed, confusing, or rambling.. 
5.
Conventions 
Score 6: The writing demonstrates exceptionally strong control of standard writing conventions
(e.g., punctuation, spelling, capitalization, grammar and usage) and uses them effectively to
enhance communication. Errors are so few and so minor that the reader can easily skim right
over them unless specifically searching for them. The writing is characterized by

strong control of conventions; manipulation of conventions may occur for stylistic
effect. 
•
strong, effective use of punctuation that guides the reader through the text.

punctuation, spelling, capitalization, grammar and usage) and uses them effectively to enhance
communication. Errors are few and minor. Conventions support readability. The writing is
characterized by 
•
strong control of conventions. 
•
effective use of punctuation that guides the reader through the text. 
•
correct spelling, even of more difficult words. 
•
correct capitalization; errors, if any, are minor.

correct grammar and usage that contribute to clarity and style. 
6 
•
skill in using a wide range of conventions in a sufficiently long and complex piece. 
•
little need for editing. 
Score 4: The writing demonstrates control of standard writing conventions (e.g., punctuation,
spelling, capitalization, grammar and usage). Significant errors do not occur frequently. Minor
errors, while perhaps noticeable, do not impede readability. The writing is characterized by 
•
control over conventions used, although a wide range is not demonstrated. 
•
correct end-of-sentence punctuation; internal punctuation may sometimes be
incorrect. 
•
spelling that is usually correct, especially on common words. 
•
correct capitalization; errors, if any, are minor. 
•
occasional lapses in correct grammar and usage; problems are not severe
enough to distort meaning or confuse the reader. 
•
moderate need for editing. 
Score 3: The writing demonstrates limited control of standard writing conventions (e.g.,
punctuation, spelling, capitalization, grammar and usage). Errors begin to impede readability.
The writing is characterized by 
•
some control over basic conventions; the text may be too simple or too short to
reveal mastery. 
•
end-of-sentence punctuation that is usually correct; however, internal punctuation
contains frequent errors. 
•
spelling errors that distract the reader; misspelling of common words occurs. 
•
capitalization errors. 
•
errors in grammar and usage that do not block meaning but do distract the
reader. 
•
significant need for editing. 
Score 2: The writing demonstrates little control of standard writing conventions. Frequent,
significant errors impede readability. The writing is characterized by 
•
little control over basic conventions.

many end-of-sentence punctuation errors; internal punctuation contains frequent
errors. 
•
spelling errors that frequently distract the reader; misspelling of common words
often occurs. 
•
capitalization that is inconsistent or often incorrect. 
•
errors in grammar and usage that interfere with readability and meaning. 
•
substantial need for editing. 
Score 1: Numerous errors in usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation repeatedly distract
the reader and make the text difficult to read. In fact, the severity and frequency of errors are so
overwhelming that the reader finds it difficult to focus on the message and must reread for
meaning. The writing is characterized by 
7 
•
very limited skill in using conventions. 
•
basic punctuation (including end-of-sentence punctuation) that tends to be
omitted, haphazard, or incorrect. 
•
frequent spelling errors that significantly impair readability. 
•
capitalization that appears to be random. 
•
a need for extensive editing. 
In case of doubts 
Since some of the ratings may be close, award the LOWER grade in case there is not enough
information, i.e. that there are too few sentences / words.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Do you think that certain materials should be removed off library's bookselfs if someone dislikes or does not agree with the topic or the plot? Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion about what the book is convincing readers?     I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self. But if I have the right to remove that book from the self- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the self for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from the arthur, Katherine Paterson, from my opinion, I believe that what she is saying is very true. Considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things, if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the self, there would not be a varity of books for people to choose from. I have sometimes gotten corious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book. They either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible. Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good. So if they had the right to remove that book I would have never got the chance to read that book.     I do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelfs just on their specific personality. Everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books. Everyone should get a large variety
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay on the important topic of book removal and censorship in public libraries. Here are some constructive points for you to consider:

1. **Clarify Your Argument**:
   - Your main argument is clear, but try to strengthen it by clearly stating your thesis in the introduction. For example, ""I believe that no book should be banned from public libraries simply because someone dislikes or disagrees with its content.""

2. **Quote and Attribution**:
   - You included a quote from Katherine Paterson, which adds value to your argument. However, ensure that quotes are accurate and properly attributed. Also, use quotation marks and provide context. The quote could be revised and formatted like this: 
     - ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf—that work I abhor—then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the shelf for any of us."" — Katherine Paterson.

3. **Spelling and Grammar**:
   - Pay attention to spelling and grammar to improve readability:
     - ""off library's bookselfs"" should be ""off the library's bookshelves.""
     - ""self"" should be ""shelf.""
     - ""arthur"" should be ""author.""
     - ""varity"" should be ""variety.""
     - ""corious"" should be ""curious.""
     - ""shelfs"" should be ""shelves.""
     - ""specific personality"" should be ""personal opinion.""

4. **Structure and Flow**:
   - Organize your essay into clear paragraphs with topic sentences. This will help guide the reader through your points. For example:
     - **Introduction**: State your thesis and outline your main points.
     - **Body Paragraphs**: Develop each point in a separate paragraph. Use evidence, examples, and quotes to support your arguments.
     - **Conclusion**: Summarize your points and restate your thesis in a compelling way.

5. **Develop Your Ideas**:
   - Expand on your examples to make your points more persuasive. For instance, when you mention asking a friend about a book, elaborate on how differing opinions illustrate the diversity of perspectives.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Your conclusion should wrap up your argument and reinforce your main points. For example: ""In conclusion, allowing individual preferences to dictate the removal of books from public libraries undermines the diversity of thought and freedom of access to information. Everyone should have the opportunity to explore a wide range of books, even those that some may find offensive or disagreeable.""

Overall, you have a strong foundation for your essay. By refining your language, structuring your argument more clearly, and expanding on your ideas, you can create a more compelling and polished piece. Keep up the good work",0.9317071400910568,0.8924690722685318
11,39,"The essay presents a general stance on the importance of preserving freedom of speech and argues against the removal of potentially offensive materials from shelves. However, the thesis is not clearly articulated, and the arguments lack coherent development and sufficient supporting details. The organization of the essay is weak, with ideas not flowing logically from one to the next and transitions between paragraphs and sentences being unclear or absent. Additionally, the word choice is simplistic and often imprecise, which detracts from the intended message. Sentence structures are repetitive and awkward, making the essay difficult to read and understand. There are numerous grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which impede readability and distract from the overall argument. Strengthening the clarity of the thesis, organizing the content more logically, varying sentence structures, and enhancing grammatical accuracy would significantly improve the essay.",39,"Your essay presents an earnest perspective on the importance of freedom of speech and personal responsibility in the context of censorship. However, several areas need significant improvement to align with our goals of clarity, grammatical precision, and effective communication.

1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis statement needs to be more explicit and grammatically precise. While your viewpoint is clear, the statement itself is convoluted and contains double negatives (""I do not feel these types of things should not be taken off the shelves""). Consider rephrasing it to clearly convey your stance.

2. **Grammar and Language Conventions**: There are numerous grammatical errors throughout your essay, including incorrect verb forms, misspelled words, and improper use of capitalization and punctuation. For instance, ""takeing away someone's freedom of speach,"" should be ""taking away someone's freedom of speech."" Additionally, ""fight"" should be ""fought,"" and ""inapprotive"" should be ""inappropriate."" Focus on using correct spelling, punctuation, and capitalization consistently.

3. **Sentence Structure and Fluency**: Your sentences often run on and lack clarity. For example, ""It not the creaters fault of the actions of how people react to what ever is put out there because the buyers have to be more responseable and make sure that what ever it is is supervised and carefully montoired."" This sentence is overly long and confusing. Break it into smaller, more manageable sentences and ensure each sentence clearly conveys a single idea.

4. **Organization**: Your essay lacks a clear and logical structure. Each paragraph should address a single point that supports your thesis, beginning with a topic sentence and followed by supporting details. Currently, your ideas are scattered and lack coherence, making it difficult for the reader to follow your argument.

5. **Word Choice**: Your word choice needs to be more precise and varied. Avoid using slang or colloquial language that may detract from the formal tone of your essay. Words like ""inappropriate"" and ""responsible"" should be spelled correctly and used appropriately to convey your message effectively.

6. **Support and Development**: While your essay includes relevant points, they are often overly general and lack depth. Each supporting argument should be well-developed with specific examples or evidence. For instance, you mention that ""certion books young children should not read because they have sex in them,"" but fail to provide a concrete example or further explanation to strengthen your argument.

7. **Conventions**: Pay attention to the standard writing conventions. There are numerous errors in spelling, capitalization, and punctuation that distract from your message. For example, ""freedom of speach"" should be ""freedom of speech,"" and ""belive"" should be ""believe.""

8. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion should effectively summarize your main points and restate your thesis in a clear, concise manner. It currently lacks a strong ending and does not effectively synthesize the arguments made throughout the essay.

Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: doing drugs, and other various risky activities are okay? I know I sure wouldn't.     Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society. It can be found nearly anywhere. In books, magazines, @CAPS1 shows, movies, on the @CAPS2, you name it. All of these are easily accessible by children of all ages. That is why there should be censorship of certain materials, to a certain degree. By this, I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library, it should only be able to be

The thesis is clear and grammatically correct, establishing a strong foundation for your viewpoint. The development of your argument is consistent, using grammatically precise sentences to emphasize the dangers of exposing young children to explicit material.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Have you ever watched or seen a book or even a movie that you do not think kids should be reading or watching? I have, heard of many books. There are even music out there that only adults should be listening too. There are some parents that are strick on what their kids watch, hear, read or sing. I know for a fact that my parents would not want me to be letting my childern read, watch or hear that kind of stuff.      When you think of the music, books, or movies that need to be out of childern

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents an understandable perspective on the importance of shielding children from inappropriate content in books, movies, and music. However, it suffers from several issues that impact its overall effectiveness. The clarity of the thesis could be improved, as it feels somewhat scattered and not grammatically polished. The arguments in support of the main idea are present but are overly simplistic and repetitive, lacking the depth and precise language needed to fully engage the reader. Additionally, the organization of the essay is quite weak, with paragraphs that do not follow a clear, logical structure and transitions that are often awkward or missing altogether. The word choice and sentence structures are basic and exhibit numerous grammatical errors, including spelling mistakes (""childern,"" ""apporaite,"" ""differnet"") and incorrect usage of words. These issues detract from the readability and overall impact of the essay. Furthermore, the conclusion, while summarizing the main points, does not effectively synthesize the arguments to leave a lasting impression. Overall, while the essay's intent is clear, it requires significant refinement in clarity, grammatical accuracy, organization, and language use to meet the stated prioritization of grammatical precision and effective communication.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I do not feel these types of things should not be taken off the shelves.What i think is that thing should come with a rateing because  this is a free country and for some one to do something like that it would be takeing away someone's freedom of speach.To many people have faught in the past for just simply freedom of speach.I think that if people rate the  thing's  that come out then they will not go in to the wrong hands. That's like saying they should have taken @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 when it first came out off the market because it has violance in it ,profange language,and guns that company will had lost a lot of money because it is inapprotive for kids.I think that parent's shouldn't go buy a @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old something like that but some parents do .It not the creaters fault of the actions of how people react to what ever is put out there because the buyers have to be more responseable and make sure that what ever it is is supervised and carefully montoired. There's an old saying ' every thing isn't made for every body' .I strongly belive that;That saying is so true .Every body don't like the same thing that some one eles likes but its okay for that person but it's not okay for you because as they say everything isn't for every body and you can't fource nothing on some one.Well every thing isn't approtive  for every one we all have are limites to every thing and if you watch what kids watch and do than things want be so inapprotive for this wold . Certion books young children should not read because they have sex in them and they talk about things that a child should not even be thinking about at that age.When children read books like that they tend to think about sex and how what they read about will feel but children should not be thinking about that type of stuff that why its there parent's responseabitly to montoir what there children read because that there job as parent's to do not the person who wrote the book because they @MONTH1 think there writing to a much older group that can relate to what there talking about but then again there just speacking there mind and infourceing there freedom of speach right one of the rights that we as a people together have been fighting for .I also feel that music help's us to express are selfs so if someone feels that the music is inapprotive for there child then they need to watch what there child is listen to.Music brings out the different moods in every body.All magazines are not for every one because as we all know there are adult magazines the produce certion imagary that children should not see but you can not blame the creater only the buyer is in fault for leaving it in the wrong place after there done with it .There just people trying to make money  off things that they know that people like.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for your essay. I appreciate the effort you put into expressing your opinions clearly. Here are some areas where you can improve your writing:

1. **Clarity and Structure**: Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Try to organize your thoughts into distinct paragraphs, each covering a specific point. This will make your argument easier to follow.

2. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are several grammatical errors and typos in your essay. For example, ""rateing"" should be ""rating,"" ""violance"" should be ""violence,"" and ""responseable"" should be ""responsible."" Using a spell checker or grammar tool can help catch these errors.

3. **Consistency and Tone**: Ensure that you maintain a consistent tone throughout your essay. Avoid using informal language like ""wanna"" or symbols like ""@"" for censoring words.

4. **Support Your Arguments**: While you present several opinions, they would be more persuasive if supported by examples or evidence. For instance, when you argue that certain books should not be for children, you could reference specific examples or studies.

5. **Sentence Structure**: Work on varying your sentence structure to enhance readability. Avoid overly long sentences, as they can be difficult to follow. For example, break down complex thoughts into shorter, clearer sentences.

6. **Punctuation and Capitalization**: Ensure correct use of punctuation and capitalization. For example, ""i"" should be ""I,"" and ""faught"" should be ""fought."" Proper punctuation will make your writing more professional and easier to read.

7. **Argument Development**: Make sure each paragraph transitions smoothly to the next. For example, when discussing freedom of speech, explain how it connects to your views on ratings and censorship more clearly.

8. **Relevance and Focus**: Stay focused on the main topic. Some parts of your essay wander off-topic, which can dilute your argument. Stick closely to your main points related to freedom of speech, censorship, and the responsibilities of creators and consumers.

Here’s a revised version of your initial statement for clarity:

""I do not believe that certain items should be removed from shelves. Instead, I think they should come with ratings. This is a free country, and removing such items would infringe on freedom of speech. Many have fought for this right. If items are properly rated, they are less likely to fall into the wrong hands.""

By concentrating on these areas, your writing will become clearer, more persuasive, and more engaging. Keep practicing, and you'll continue to improve!",0.9356486924197893,0.9049445987907296
12,42,"The essay effectively attempts to address the prompt, detailing how the setting impacts the cyclist in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" However, the response falls short in several areas. The content touches on some significant points but lacks depth and specificity in its supporting evidence. The thesis, while present, is not articulated clearly, making it harder for the reader to grasp the writer's main argument from the onset. Additionally, the response occasionally strays off-topic, and some points are underdeveloped. The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the text but doesn't fully engage with it. Language use is somewhat limited, with noticeable grammatical errors and a lack of varied vocabulary, which detracts from the overall quality of the writing. The organization of the essay is basic, and while there are attempts at transitions, they are not consistently effective, resulting in a disjointed narrative flow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing more detailed and specific evidence from the text, ensuring clear and cohesive argumentation, and enhancing grammatical accuracy and vocabulary range.",42,"Thank you for your effort in analyzing how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" Your essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the prompt, but there are several areas where you can improve to make your writing clearer and more engaging.

1. **Thesis Statement:** Your thesis statement is present but somewhat vague. It would benefit from a clearer and more precise articulation. Instead of saying ""because it goes to many different terrains,"" you could specify how these terrains impact the cyclist's journey and well-being.

   **Example:** ""The diverse and harsh terrains encountered by the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit' significantly strain his physical endurance and mental resolve, ultimately threatening his survival.""

2. **Content Development:** While you include some examples from the text, your essay would be stronger with more detailed analysis and integration of these examples. Instead of summarizing events, focus on explaining how specific features of the setting create obstacles for the cyclist.

   **Example:** ""The cyclist starts his journey optimistically, but the abandoned towns he encounters symbolize isolation and desolation, compounding his growing sense of hopelessness. For instance, the ghost town he first arrives at underscores his vulnerability, foreshadowing the challenges ahead.""

3. **Grammar and Language:** There are several grammatical errors that need attention. Phrases like ""his working his way"" should be corrected to ""he is working his way."" Additionally, ensure the correct spelling of words such as ""different"" and proper punctuation throughout the essay.

4. **Sentence Structure and Vocabulary:** Aim to vary your sentence structure to avoid repetitiveness and enhance readability. Incorporate a wider range of vocabulary to make your narrative more engaging.

   **Example:** ""As he progresses, the cyclist encounters not only rolling hills and tumbleweeds but also an aggressive snake, all of which further deplete his energy and resources.""

5. **Transitions and Organization:** Your essay would benefit from clearer transitions between points to improve the logical flow. Each paragraph should start with a topic sentence that previews the main idea and help guide the reader through your argument.

   **Example:** ""Moreover, the intense heat and lack of water become critical threats to the cyclist’s survival. Despite the old men’s assurances, the unforgiving environment proves almost fatal.""

6. **Conclusion:** Your conclusion should effectively summarize the main points and restate how the setting impacts the cyclist. It should tie back to your thesis, reinforcing your argument.

   **Example:** ""In conclusion, the treacherous terrains and extreme conditions the cyclist faces in 'Rough Road Ahead' not only test his physical limits but also his mental resilience, highlighting the profound impact of setting on his harrowing journey.""

By focusing on these areas, you can enhance the clarity, coherence, and overall quality of your essay. Keep up the good work, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you need further clarification or assistance","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit, affected the cyclist greatly. For starters it says he was traveling through the high desserts which is never a safe thing. He had been drinking he water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was, trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state. From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into A far like substance The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay on the influence of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit"" struggles significantly with clarity, coherence, and adherence to grammatical conventions. The thesis statement is vague and not clearly defined. The essay attempts to discuss how the setting affects the cyclist but lacks specific examples and detailed support from the text, resulting in a superficial response. Many sentences are grammatically incorrect or fragmented, which makes the narrative disjointed and difficult to follow. The organization is weak, with an unclear structure that lacks smooth transitions between ideas. There are numerous spelling and punctuation errors, which further impede readability. Overall, the essay fails to effectively communicate its points due to insufficient content development and weak language control. There is a need for a more structured approach, including a clear thesis, well-supported arguments, and a focus on grammatical accuracy to enhance the overall quality of the writing.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The features of the setting in the essay Do not exceed the posted speed limit affected the cyclist in a negative way. The more and more he rode, he thought more negatively and had alot of doubt. The cyclist was not very confident, he thought he wouldnt make it. For example, when the cyclist notices nothing in sight, his tone changes. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon telling

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic understanding of how the features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist, but it lacks depth and specificity in its analysis. The thesis is not entirely clear and could benefit from a more precise statement. The development of arguments includes some examples from the memoir, but these are not thoroughly analyzed or integrated into a cohesive argument. The writing demonstrates frequent grammatical errors, such as ""alot of doubt"" instead of ""a lot of doubt,"" and issues with sentence structure that impede readability. The organization shows potential but needs clearer, more grammatically correct transitions and topic sentences to enhance the logical flow. The language used is somewhat repetitive and lacks variety, which diminishes the overall impact. While the narrative does employ some transitional phrases, it could be more polished to ensure smoother transitions and a more engaging narrative. Overall, the essay could greatly benefit from a more focused thesis, detailed support from the text, and meticulous proofreading to address grammatical inaccuracies.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The features of the setting affect the cyclist because his body has a hard time adjusting to his life threating situation. The neat and desert atmosphere are draining his body of water, @CAPS1 he needs to keep pedaling on. Also, the terrain is stripped of water, so he doesn't have anything to refuel with.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to address the prompt by discussing how the setting affects the cyclist, but it falls short in several areas. The thesis statement is present but not clearly articulated, and the sentences contain numerous grammatical errors that detract from the overall clarity and readability. The development and support of arguments are weak, with limited evidence from the memoir to substantiate the points made. Additionally, the conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis. Organization is lacking as the essay jumps from one point to another without clear transitions or topic sentences, making it difficult to follow the narrative. The language and style are also problematic, with a limited vocabulary and repetitive sentence structures that do not enhance the essay's persuasiveness. There are significant errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization that further impede readability. Overall, the essay needs substantial improvement in grammatical precision, organization, and the use of supporting evidence to effectively communicate its message.

DOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit 
by Joe Kurmaskie 
FORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece 
of advice for the solo cyclist would be, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers 
who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” It’s not that a group of 
old guys doesn’t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid 
place. Things change. 
At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer 
evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn’t have done was 
let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice 
and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to 
Yosemite National Park. 
They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I 
would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with 
strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town.” 
This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time—say, before the last world war—but 
on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water 
supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool 
pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. 
Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, 
and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had 
been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of 
California in June. 
I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my 
strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the 
neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water 
wouldn’t cool down. It didn’t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. 
The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make 
that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so—a test of my inner spirit. 
Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was 
replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign 
jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. 
The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so 
cruel. 
I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it 
really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased 
past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. 
The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my 
shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June 
simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, 
caused me to laugh. 
It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. 
There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride 
down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d 
be fine. 
Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make 
sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst 
of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. 
In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building—abandoned years 
earlier, by the looks of it—had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A 
sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still 
be seen. 
I hung my head. 
That smoky blues tune “Summertime” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating 
brain. 
I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. 
I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you 
have left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. 
It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some 
expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and 
their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I 
was going to lose consciousness for the last time. 
Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining 
elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear 
were all behind me. 
GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP—IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE 
YOUR BEST BET! 
“And the only bet,” I remember thinking. 
As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an 
overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait—any bait, even 
though I didn’t own a rod or reel. 
An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from 
my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. 
“Where you headed in such a hurry?” 
“Yosemite,” I whispered. 
“Know the best way to get there?” 
I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group 
I’d listened to in Lodi. 
“Yes, sir! I own a very good map.” 
And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.

13,52,"Your essay on ""Winter Hibiscus"" has several areas that need improvement to meet the guidelines provided. Firstly, your thesis statement is unclear and lacks grammatical correctness, making it difficult to grasp the main argument of your response. The development and support of your arguments are minimal, and the sentences used are not grammatically precise, which impacts the clarity of your points. Additionally, the conclusion does not effectively summarize the thesis. The organization of your essay is also problematic; the paragraphs lack logical structure and clear, grammatically correct transitions and topic sentences. The language and style are quite rudimentary, with limited vocabulary and incorrect sentence structures that detract from the overall quality of the essay. In terms of conventions, there are several grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which further hinder readability. To improve, focus on creating a clear, grammatically correct thesis statement, develop your arguments with precise, varied sentences, and ensure your conclusion effectively summarizes your main points. Organize your paragraphs logically, with clear transitions and topic sentences, and pay close attention to grammatical accuracy and correct language usage throughout.",52,"Your essay provides a thoughtful attempt to engage with the prompt, but there are several key areas that need improvement to enhance clarity and effectiveness.

1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis, centered around Saeng's determination to take the test again, is a good start but lacks grammatical precision and coherence. Consider revising it to be clearer and more direct. For example: ""The author concludes with this paragraph to highlight Saeng's determination to overcome failure and her connection to her heritage through the hibiscus.""

2. **Supporting Arguments**: While you do mention that Saeng is determined to retake the test and that the hibiscus symbolizes her grandmother's presence, these points need more detailed elaboration and stronger textual evidence. Explain how the hibiscus and her grandmother's memory specifically give Saeng the strength and encouragement to try again.

3. **Grammatical Precision**: There are several grammatical errors that detract from the readability of your essay. For instance, ""the auther put this paragraph"" should be ""the author included this paragraph."" Additionally, ""if the flower budds"" should be corrected to ""if the flower buds."" Pay close attention to spelling, punctuation, and capitalization to ensure grammatical accuracy throughout your essay.

4. **Sentence Structure and Flow**: Your sentences would benefit from more variety and precision. For example, instead of ""Her grandmother's resemblance is in the flower so if the flower budds, then her grandmother will be back in a sense,"" you could say, ""The hibiscus flower symbolizes her grandmother’s presence, and its budding signifies a renewal of strength and encouragement for Saeng.""

5. **Transitions and Paragraph Structure**: Improve the organization of your essay by ensuring smooth transitions between ideas. This will help create a more cohesive and logically structured argument. Each paragraph should flow naturally into the next, supporting the overall thesis.

6. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion should effectively summarize the main points and tie back to the thesis. Currently, it ends abruptly without reinforcing the key arguments you’ve made. Consider summarizing how Saeng’s determination and the symbolic meaning of the hibiscus contribute to the story’s theme of perseverance and adaptation.

By focusing on these areas, you can enhance the clarity, coherence, and grammatical precision of your essay, making your argument more compelling and easier to understand. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you encounter any difficulties. Your effort and dedication will surely lead to improvement.

**Revised Example**:
""In 'Winter Hibiscus,' the author concludes with the statement, 'When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.' This paragraph underscores Saeng's resolve to overcome her failure and adapt to her new life in the United States. The hibiscus flower symbolizes not only her grandmother’s presence but also Saeng's own strength and resilience. As the","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the story with  When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better.  A wave of loss so deep and

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a solid effort but struggles with clarity and structure. The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like its going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when shell retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus comes back to life. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good shell feel good

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic attempt to engage with the prompt, but it lacks clarity and depth. The thesis is not clearly stated, making it difficult for readers to understand the main argument. The development of ideas is minimal and somewhat confusing. For example, instead of explaining why the author concluded the story with a statement about a new beginning, the essay drifts into discussing various unrelated aspects. Grammatical errors such as ""about,"" ""is,"" ""desrves,"" and inconsistent verb tenses detract significantly from the readability and flow of the essay. Additionally, the sentence structures are not varied, and the vocabulary is simple and often used incorrectly, leading to a monotonous tone. The paragraph lacks proper transitions, making it disjointed and hard to follow. There is also a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points made, which weakens the overall argument. For future improvement, the writer should focus on crafting a clear thesis, using varied and precise language, and providing specific examples to support their arguments, all while maintaining grammatical accuracy.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succed, one must keep trying. Saeng will adapt to her new copiuntry in time but not if she spends heer time wishing to go back to her homeland. The hibiscus is a reminder to hers of starting a new and adapting to society. Saeng will retry her drivers test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided lacks clarity and is fraught with grammatical errors, which significantly impede its readability and effectiveness. The thesis statement is somewhat unclear, and the supporting sentences contain numerous mistakes, reducing the impact of the arguments presented. Consequently, the essay does not adequately address the prompt, nor does it remain focused on any coherent argument about Saeng's adaptation to her new country. The sentences are often incomplete or awkwardly structured, further detracting from the essay's overall readability. Additionally, the essay lacks a logical flow, with transitions that are neither smooth nor grammatically correct. The conclusion is abrupt and fails to effectively summarize the thesis, leaving the reader with an incomplete understanding of the author's main points. Improvements in grammatical accuracy, clearer thesis articulation, better organizational structure, and more precise language usage are needed to enhance the quality and coherence of this essay.

======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======
DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus 
by Minfong Ho 
Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng
walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist
shop to see if the plant can be purchased. 
It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat
leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in
seemingly random profusion. 
“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy
potted plant by the corner. 
There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals
splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of
recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 
“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. 
A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with
vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into
the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the
bucket. 
Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,
oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had
not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. 
When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and
cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel. 
And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with
purplish petals and white centers. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced. How strange to
see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick
walls or between tiled roofs. 
And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and
found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.
“Dok Malik,” she said,
savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its
tag, “jasmine.” 
One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed
her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could
almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she
combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng
would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. 
Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm
around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed
comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? 
A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a
channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. 
And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. 
It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the
last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.
As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of
the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to
her. 
Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. “Ghup ma laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully.
“Goodness, it’s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?” Then she noticed
the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. 
Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. “Where
did you get it?” 
“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question. 
“How much?” 
For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. 
“That’s all?” Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the 
Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .” 
“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said. 
“Then what else—?” 
“Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” 
“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously. “But how could you? All the seeds for this
vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed
the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. 
“What happened?” she asked, more gently. 
“I—I failed the test,” Saeng said. 
For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the
eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. 
Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng’s hands. “It’s a beautiful
plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.” 
“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. 
“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the
words at home, lest she burst into tears again. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said. 
“I know,” her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t
as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.
That’s what matters.” 
She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her
other hand. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said. “Let’s plant it, right now.” 
She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The
soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair
trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There
was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. 
“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. 
Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and
start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?” 
“I’d love it,” Saeng said. 
Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.
She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,
the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth
watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not
even Mrs. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.
But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. 
The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.
Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng
now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange
before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her
now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against
the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. 
When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the
geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

FEEDBACK: 
","FEEDBACK:

Dear Student,

Thank you for your effort in writing this essay on ""Winter Hibiscus."" You’ve highlighted an important aspect of the story and conveyed Saeng’s determination effectively. Here are some points for improvement and strengths to help you develop your writing further:

**Strengths:**
1. **Understanding of the Text:** You have a clear grasp of the story's conclusion and the symbolic meaning behind the hibiscus flower.
2. **Insightful Analysis:** You provided a thoughtful interpretation of Saeng’s vow and how it signifies her perseverance and hope for the future.
3. **Connecting Themes:** You made a meaningful connection between Saeng's determination and her grandmother’s symbolic presence.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Clarity and Consistency:** Ensure that each sentence clearly communicates your ideas. For example, the sentence ""Her grandmother's resemblance is in the flower so if the flower budds, then her grandmother will be back in a sense"" could be rephrased for clarity.
2. **Grammar and Spelling:** Pay attention to grammatical errors and spelling, such as ""auther"" (author) and ""budds"" (buds). Proofreading your essay can help catch these mistakes.
3. **Pronoun Consistency:** Be consistent with pronouns. In the last sentence, ""when he grandmother 'comes back' then @PERSON1"" needs correction. Replace ""@PERSON1"" with ""Saeng"" and ensure pronouns match the subject.
4. **Quotations:** When quoting text, use proper punctuation and ensure it blends smoothly with your sentences. Also, consider integrating your analysis more fluidly with the quoted material.
5. **Depth of Analysis:** While you’ve identified Saeng’s determination, expanding on how this determination impacts her character development throughout the story could add depth to your analysis.

**Revised Example:**
""The author concludes 'Winter Hibiscus' with Saeng's vow: 'when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.' This final thought emphasizes Saeng’s resolve to change her circumstances. Although she failed the test initially, she is determined to try again. The hibiscus flower, symbolizing her grandmother's presence, gives Saeng strength and encouragement. When the hibiscus buds in spring, it signifies her grandmother's spiritual return, motivating Saeng to retake the test with renewed hope and support.""

Keep up the good work, and continue to refine your writing skills. Your insights are valuable, and with some adjustments, you can express them more effectively.

14,53,"The essay provided has significant room for improvement in terms of clarity, structure, and content. The thesis statement is vague and lacks grammatical accuracy, which makes it difficult to grasp the central idea at first glance. The arguments are underdeveloped, and the sentences are not constructed with the grammatical precision expected. The conclusion simply reiterates the thesis without effectively summarizing the points made, leading to a lack of cohesion in the overall argument. Furthermore, the organization of the essay is fragmented; paragraphs do not flow logically from one to the next, and transitions are either weak or absent. This, combined with simplistic and sometimes incorrect word choices, undermines the intended message. Additionally, the essay contains numerous grammatical errors, including issues with punctuation and sentence structure, which distract the reader and impede readability. To score higher, the writer should focus on crafting a clear and grammatically correct thesis, developing arguments with well-structured and grammatically accurate sentences, and ensuring that the conclusion effectively encapsulates the main ideas. Improving the logical flow between paragraphs and enhancing word choice will also contribute to a more engaging and effective essay.",53,"Your essay shows an initial attempt to address the prompt; however, it requires significant improvements to meet the expectations for clarity, depth, and grammatical accuracy. Here are some targeted areas for enhancement:

1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis lacks precision and clarity. Instead of simply stating that ""it's a very good ending paragraph,"" aim to articulate why the author chose this conclusion in relation to the broader themes of the story. For example, discuss how the final paragraph reflects Saeng's emotional journey and determination to adapt to her new life.

2. **Development of Ideas**: The arguments presented are underdeveloped. You need to provide specific examples from the text to support your points. Explain how the imagery of spring, the melting snow, and the budding hibiscus symbolize renewal and Saeng's resolve to overcome her challenges.

3. **Grammatical Accuracy**: There are several grammatical issues that need attention. For example, ""its"" should be ""it's,"" and ""determind"" should be ""determined."" Focusing on these details will enhance the readability and professionalism of your essay.

4. **Sentence Structure and Vocabulary**: Your sentences are quite simple and repetitive, which detracts from the engagement of the reader. Try to use varied sentence structures and a broader range of vocabulary to make your writing more interesting and dynamic.

5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion needs to effectively tie back to your thesis and summarize the key points made in your essay. Ensure that it reinforces the significance of the final paragraph in the context of Saeng's personal growth and determination.

### Example Revision:
""The author concludes the story with this paragraph to highlight Saeng's resolve and the symbolic significance of spring. The imagery of melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus encapsulates themes of renewal and hope. This final paragraph underscores Saeng's determination to assimilate into her new life in the United States despite the challenges she faces. It is a powerful conclusion that not only captures Saeng's personal growth but also provides a hopeful outlook for her future.""

### Next Steps:
- **Revise your thesis** to clearly state the connection between the concluding paragraph and the story's themes.
- **Expand your arguments** by including specific examples from the text that support your points.
- **Proofread** for grammatical errors and improve sentence variety and vocabulary.

Remember, precision, clarity, and well-supported arguments are key to effective writing. If you have any questions or need further guidance, please feel free to ask.","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memoreies of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring. This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The concluding paragraph of the essay presents several issues related to clarity, structure, and content. The overall message is somewhat muddled due to confusing syntax and word choice, which detracts from the intended emphasis on the author's memories of her homeland. The paragraph could benefit from more precise language and a clearer connection between the memories evoked by the spring season and the author's decision to retake her driving test. Additionally, the development of the argument lacks coherence, with details about animals and blossoming trees feeling tangential and underdeveloped. The organization is also weak, as transitions between sentences are abrupt, making the narrative hard to follow. Furthermore, grammatical errors such as ""memoreies,"" ""beautifu,"" and several awkward phrasings, impede readability and distract from the content. To improve, the essay should focus on refining sentence structures, ensuring grammatical accuracy, and creating a more logical flow of ideas to effectively convey the emotional significance of the author's memories.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like its going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when shell retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus comes back to life. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good shell feel good

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic attempt to engage with the prompt, but it lacks clarity and depth. The thesis is not clearly stated, making it difficult for readers to understand the main argument. The development of ideas is minimal and somewhat confusing. For example, instead of explaining why the author concluded the story with a statement about a new beginning, the essay drifts into discussing various unrelated aspects. Grammatical errors such as ""about,"" ""is,"" ""desrves,"" and inconsistent verb tenses detract significantly from the readability and flow of the essay. Additionally, the sentence structures are not varied, and the vocabulary is simple and often used incorrectly, leading to a monotonous tone. The paragraph lacks proper transitions, making it disjointed and hard to follow. There is also a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points made, which weakens the overall argument. For future improvement, the writer should focus on crafting a clear thesis, using varied and precise language, and providing specific examples to support their arguments, all while maintaining grammatical accuracy.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a solid effort but struggles with clarity and structure. The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.

======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======
DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus 
by Minfong Ho 
Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng
walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist
shop to see if the plant can be purchased. 
It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat
leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in
seemingly random profusion. 
“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy
potted plant by the corner. 
There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals
splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of
recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 
“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. 
A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with
vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into
the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the
bucket. 
Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,
oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had
not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. 
When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and
cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel. 
And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with
purplish petals and white centers. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced. How strange to
see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick
walls or between tiled roofs. 
And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and
found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.
“Dok Malik,” she said,
savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its
tag, “jasmine.” 
One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed
her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could
almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she
combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng
would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. 
Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm
around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed
comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? 
A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a
channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. 
And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. 
It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the
last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.
As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of
the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to
her. 
Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. “Ghup ma laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully.
“Goodness, it’s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?” Then she noticed
the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. 
Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. “Where
did you get it?” 
“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question. 
“How much?” 
For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. 
“That’s all?” Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the 
Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .” 
“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said. 
“Then what else—?” 
“Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” 
“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously. “But how could you? All the seeds for this
vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed
the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. 
“What happened?” she asked, more gently. 
“I—I failed the test,” Saeng said. 
For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the
eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. 
Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng’s hands. “It’s a beautiful
plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.” 
“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. 
“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the
words at home, lest she burst into tears again. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said. 
“I know,” her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t
as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.
That’s what matters.” 
She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her
other hand. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said. “Let’s plant it, right now.” 
She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The
soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair
trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There
was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. 
“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. 
Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and
start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?” 
“I’d love it,” Saeng said. 
Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.
She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,
the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth
watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not
even Mrs. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.
But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. 
The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.
Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng
now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange
before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her
now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against
the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. 
When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the
geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its a very good ending paragraph that grabs your attention a little bit. Also it shows that the girl is determined to pass her test, so that makes you think this is a determind story. This is why the author concluded the story with this paragraph.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay! Here are some specific points of feedback to help you improve:

1. **Clarity and Specificity**: Your essay could benefit from more specific details. For instance, instead of stating that ""it's a very good ending paragraph that grabs your attention,"" explain exactly what makes it attention-grabbing. Is it the suspense, the language, or perhaps the character's resolve?

2. **Sentence Structure**: Try to vary your sentence structure to make your writing more engaging. For example, instead of saying ""Also it shows that the girl is determined to pass her test,"" you might say, ""Additionally, the girl's determination to pass her test is clearly depicted.""

3. **Grammar and Spelling**: Pay attention to grammar and proper word usage. ""Its"" should be ""it's"" (it is), and ""determind"" should be ""determined."" Small errors like these can detract from your overall message.

4. **Depth of Analysis**: Dive deeper into why the ending is effective. Discuss how the author's choice of words, the development of the character, and the story arc contribute to a satisfying conclusion.

5. **Structure and Coherence**: Ensure that each sentence logically follows the previous one and that your paragraph has a clear beginning, middle, and end. This will help your reader follow your argument more easily.

Here’s a revised version incorporating these points:

""The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it effectively captures the reader's attention through its suspenseful tone and the vivid portrayal of the protagonist's determination. The girl's resolve to pass her test is not only a testament to her character but also serves as a powerful conclusion that underscores the theme of perseverance. This deliberate choice by the author ensures that readers are left with a lasting impression of the story's message.""

Keep up the good work, and continue to focus on these areas to further enhance your writing skills!",0.8921612292855101,0.8893572408250129
15,54,"Your essay demonstrates an effort to address the question, but it falls short in several key areas. The thesis, which aims to explain why the author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a particular paragraph, is not clearly articulated. While you attempt to provide examples from the story, the connections between these examples and the thesis are unclear and underdeveloped. This results in a response that feels somewhat disjointed and unfocused. While your language shows some grasp of grammar and spelling, frequent errors detract from the overall readability and clarity. Moreover, the narrative flow is inconsistent, making it challenging for readers to follow your argument. To improve, ensure that your thesis is explicitly stated and supported with well-chosen, specific examples from the text. Additionally, focus on varying your sentence structures and refining your grammatical accuracy to enhance the overall clarity and impact of your writing.",54,"Your essay demonstrates a promising start, but there are several areas that need improvement for better clarity and coherence. Let's break down some of the key points:

1. **Thesis Statement**:
   - Your thesis statement is somewhat vague and lacks precision. The statement, ""it has a 'touching' affect to the reader and it basically sums up all the paints talked about in the story,"" needs to be clearer and more specific. Instead, consider something like, ""The author concludes the story with this paragraph to evoke a sense of resolution and emotional connection, encapsulating the main themes of hope and perseverance.""

2. **Supporting Evidence**:
   - While you attempt to use quotes to support your points, the integration and explanation of these quotes need refinement. For example, you mention, ""Saeng vowed silently to herself,” but you don't fully explain how this quote creates imagery or why it's significant. Elaborate on how this imagery contributes to the story's emotional impact.
   - Your second example, ""When the geese return hibiscus is budding I will take that test again,"" is relevant but needs deeper analysis. Explain what the geese and hibiscus symbolize and how they relate to Saeng's personal growth and determination.

3. **Language and Grammar**:
   - There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrases that detract from the essay’s readability. For instance, ""author lend them many different ways"" should be ""authors end their stories in many different ways.""
   - Ensure correct use of punctuation and capitalization, such as ""touching effect"" instead of ""touching affect"" and ""points"" instead of ""paints.""
   - Work on sentence structure to avoid run-on sentences and make your writing more concise and varied.

4. **Organization and Flow**:
   - The essay needs better transitions between ideas to improve flow. Use linking words to guide the reader through your argument logically.
   - Your conclusion should effectively summarize your main points and restate the thesis in a more refined way. Currently, it ends abruptly and doesn't provide a strong closure to your argument.

5. **Prompt Adherence**:
   - While you address the prompt, the response could benefit from a more focused and thorough analysis. Make sure each point you make directly ties back to explaining why the author chose to conclude the story with that specific paragraph, using detailed evidence from the text.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- Spend time revising your thesis statement to make it more specific.
- Provide deeper analysis and explanation of the quotes you use.
- Focus on grammatical accuracy and varied sentence structure.
- Improve transitions for better coherence and flow.
- Strengthen your conclusion to effectively tie all your points together.

Overall, your essay shows potential, but more effort is needed in clarity, structure, and grammatical precision. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you need further clarification or help with any aspect of your writing. Keep practicing, and you're sure to make significant progress!","

Consequently, the essay does not adequately address the prompt, nor does it remain focused on any coherent argument about Saeng's adaptation to her new country. The sentences are often incomplete or awkwardly structured, further detracting from the essay's overall readability. Additionally, the essay lacks a logical flow, with transitions that are neither smooth nor grammatically correct. The conclusion is abrupt and fails to effectively summarize the thesis, leaving the reader with an incomplete understanding of the author's main points. Improvements in grammatical accuracy, clearer thesis articulation, better organizational structure, and more precise language usage are needed to enhance the quality and coherence of this essay.

DOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus 
by Minfong Ho 
Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng
walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist
shop to see if the plant can be purchased. 
It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat
leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in
seemingly random profusion. 
“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy
potted plant by the corner. 
There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals
splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of
recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 
“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. 
A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with
vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into
the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the
bucket. 
Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,
oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had
not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. 
When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and
cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel. 
And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with
purplish petals and white centers. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced. How strange to
see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick
walls or between tiled roofs. 
And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and
found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.
“Dok Malik,” she said,
savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its
tag, “jasmine.” 
One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed
her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could
almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she
combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng
would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. 
Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm
around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed
comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? 
A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a
channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. 
And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. 
It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the
last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.
As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of
the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to
her. 
Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. “Ghup ma laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully.
“Goodness, it’s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?” Then she noticed
the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. 
Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. “Where
did you get it?” 
“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question. 
“How much?” 
For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. 
“That’s all?” Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the 
Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .” 
“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said. 
“Then what else—?” 
“Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” 
“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously. “But how could you? All the seeds for this
vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed
the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. 
“What happened?” she asked, more gently. 
“I—I failed the test,” Saeng said. 
For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the
eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. 
Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng’s hands. “It’s a beautiful
plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.” 
“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. 
“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the
words at home, lest she burst into tears again. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said. 
“I know,” her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t
as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.
That’s what matters.” 
She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her
other hand. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said. “Let’s plant it, right now.” 
She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The
soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair
trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There
was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. 
“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. 
Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and
start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?” 
“I’d love it,” Saeng said. 
Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.
She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,
the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth
watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not
even Mrs. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.
But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. 
The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.
Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng
now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange
before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her
now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against
the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. 
When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the
geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: In stories, author lend them many different ways with many different effects. In the story, Winter Hibiscus the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has a touching affect to the reader and it basically sums up all the paints talked about in the story. The first example, is in the beginning of the conclusion, it says Saeng vowed silently to herself. In this unique quote, the author demonstrates imagery by giving you a mental picture of a silent lonly girl nealing down in the cold garden, whispering silently to herself. This quote and this part of the quote has a touching effect to the reader. Another example of why the author concludes the story with this is because it sums up all the parts covered in the story. ""When the geese return hibiscus is budding I will take that test again This quote mentions the hibiscus which is mentioned a lot throughout, the geese in the end, and the failing of the test in the beginning. In conclusion, thats why the author used that paragraph as the conclusion for such a touching story.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","**FEEDBACK:**

Thank you for your efforts on this essay! You have made a good attempt at analyzing the conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" and its effects on the reader. Here are some areas where you can improve and some suggestions to help you:

1. **Clarity and Structure:**
   - Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Begin with an introductory paragraph that briefly introduces the story and your main argument.
   - Each paragraph should focus on a single point or example that supports your argument. Use topic sentences to make it clear what each paragraph will discuss.

2. **Grammar and Syntax:**
   - Pay attention to your grammar and syntax. For example, ""author lend them many different ways"" should be ""authors end their stories in many different ways.""
   - Make sure each sentence is complete and clear. For instance, ""In the story, Winter Hibiscus the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has a 'touching' affect to the reader and it basically sums up all the paints talked about in the story"" can be improved to: ""In 'Winter Hibiscus,' the author concludes the story with a touching paragraph that effectively sums up the main points discussed throughout.""

3. **Word Choice:**
   - Be careful with word choice. The word ""affect"" should be ""effect"" in this context. Also, ""paints"" should be ""points.""
   - Avoid repetition by finding synonyms and varying your sentence structure.

4. **Evidence and Analysis:**
   - Your essay mentions quotes from the story, which is great. However, each quote should be followed by a more detailed analysis that ties it back to your main argument. Explain why the imagery is unique and how it contributes to the touching effect.
   - Make sure to provide a bit more context for each quote to help the reader understand its significance within the story.

5. **Polish and Proofread:**
   - Always proofread your work for spelling errors and typos. For example, ""lonly"" should be ""lonely,"" and ""nealing"" should be ""kneeling.""
   - Consider reading your essay out loud to catch any errors or awkward phrasing.

Here is a revised version of your first paragraph to illustrate some of these points:

---

**Revised Paragraph:**

In literature, authors conclude their stories in various ways to invoke different effects on the reader. In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author ends the story with a poignant paragraph that deeply touches the reader and encapsulates the central themes of the narrative. For example, the phrase ""Saeng vowed silently to herself"" creates a vivid image of a lonely girl kneeling in the cold garden, whispering her resolve. This imagery provides a powerful emotional connection for the reader. Furthermore, the line ""When the geese return and hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" ties together key elements from the story: the hibiscus mentioned throughout, the ge",0.8999727312326247,0.9234624488736751
16,56,"The essay demonstrates a heartfelt and engaging narrative, providing a vivid portrayal of the challenges and joys of immigrant life. The author effectively conveys the cultural richness and familial bonds in their upbringing, using specific examples from the memoir to support their points. However, the essay sometimes lacks clarity in connecting back to a clear thesis statement, making it difficult to fully grasp the central argument. While the content is interesting and flows smoothly, occasional grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures detract from its overall clarity and polish. The language is generally good, with a varied vocabulary that enhances the narrative, but there are instances where word choice could be more precise. Overall, the essay offers a meaningful reflection on the importance of family and cultural heritage, yet it could be strengthened by a more defined thesis and attention to grammatical precision.",56,"Your essay demonstrates a thoughtful engagement with the memoir and a clear effort to convey the positive aspects of Narciso's experience despite the challenges faced by his family. However, there are several areas that need attention to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your writing.

**Thesis Statement:**
Your thesis statement is somewhat vague and could be more precise. It is important to clearly state the mood created by the author and how it is conveyed through specific elements of the memoir. Consider revising it to something more direct, such as: ""The memoir 'Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' by Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood of warmth and contentment by celebrating Cuban culture and the strong sense of community within the author's family.""

**Supporting Evidence:**
You have included a relevant quote from the memoir, which is a good start. However, your analysis of the quote could be more detailed and directly tied to your thesis. Explain how the specific elements in the quote (childhood innocence, family gatherings, celebrations) contribute to the overall mood of warmth and contentment. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include more quotes or examples from the text to further support your points.

**Grammar and Language:**
There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that need to be addressed for better clarity and readability:
- ""Living life in a country or place away can be very difficult from what I've known, heard and seen."" This sentence is unclear and could be rephrased for better understanding. Consider: ""Living in a foreign country can be very challenging, as I have learned from various accounts.""
- ""Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally."" This sentence is somewhat confusing. Consider revising it to: ""Poverty, along with occasional racism and discrimination, often complicates the situation.""
- ""Nonetheless, this well-told memoir tells of the contentment and good side of it all."" This sentence could be clearer. Consider: ""Nonetheless, the memoir highlights the contentment and positive aspects of life in their new home.""

**Organization and Structure:**
Your essay would benefit from a more structured organization. Begin with a clear introduction that includes your revised thesis statement. Follow with body paragraphs that each focus on a specific point or piece of evidence from the memoir, and provide detailed analysis. Conclude with a strong paragraph that summarizes your points and reinforces your thesis.

**Vocabulary and Sentence Variety:**
Your vocabulary is somewhat limited and repetitive in places. Try to incorporate more varied and precise language to make your writing more engaging. Additionally, varying your sentence structure can help maintain the reader's interest and improve the flow of your essay.

**Conclusion:**
Your conclusion is currently missing. Make sure to include a concluding paragraph that effectively summarizes your main points and reinforces the mood created by the memoir. This will help tie your essay together and leave a lasting impression on the reader.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a heartfelt and detailed account of the author's upbringing in a traditional Cuban home. The narrative effectively evokes a warm and comforting mood, supported by specific examples from the memoir. However, there are several grammatical errors and inconsistencies that detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. For instance, the use of ""@CAPS1"" appears to be a placeholder or redaction, which disrupts the flow of the text and makes it difficult to follow. Additionally, there are punctuation issues, such as the use of ampersands (&) instead of ""and,"" and some sentences are overly complex or improperly structured. The organization of the essay is mostly clear, with logical progression from one idea to the next, but some transitions could be smoother. The vocabulary is somewhat varied, though there are instances of repetition and incorrect usage. Overall, while the essay is interesting and provides a vivid portrayal of the author's family life, it would benefit greatly from a thorough review to correct grammatical errors and improve sentence structure.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created in this memoir is friendship. One reason is because his parents let the door open for the peope they considered family. A quote that shows this is ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors to the many people we consider family. This shows that the mood is friendship because his parents are great friends to their family.        A second reason is the importance of friend ship. A quote that shows this is ""the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay in question demonstrates a clear effort to convey the memoir's themes of friendship and family. However, it falls short in several key areas. The thesis statement is somewhat unclear and lacks grammatical accuracy. The arguments are presented, but they lack depth and sufficient development, making the supporting evidence seem superficial. Additionally, the sentences are grammatically correct but often simplistic and repetitive, leading to a lack of complexity and variation in word choice and sentence structure. The organization of the essay is weak, with transitions and topic sentences that do not effectively guide the reader through the argument. Furthermore, there are noticeable errors in spelling and punctuation, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. To improve, the writer should focus on crafting a clear and grammatically correct thesis statement, developing arguments with greater depth and precision, and ensuring that transitions and topic sentences are logically structured and grammatically accurate. Enhanced vocabulary and varied sentence structures would also contribute to a more engaging and effective essay.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the story with  When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better.  A wave of loss so deep and

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a solid effort but struggles with clarity and structure. The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.

DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 5 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Narciso Rodriguez 
from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives 
My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a 
furnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old 
Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon 
call home. 
In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the 
Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our 
traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared 
cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking 
that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which 
I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of 
childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed 
both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. 
Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that “family” had nothing to do with 
being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, 
Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation 
prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these 
cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of 
honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their 
own kind, were clearly in need. 
Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and 
Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio 
and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not 
know my “real” grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were 
allowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and 
Rosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family 
members came and went — and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they 
were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the 
many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. 
My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the 
language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a 
better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country 
they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters 
while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were 
strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind 
of jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had 
studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, 
taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their 
children to better times drove them to endure these hard times. 
I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I’ve often told them that what 
they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I’ve often told them of 
my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I’ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in 
reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at 
such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two 
lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these 
teachings have been the basis of my life. 
It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to 
this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this 
humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not 
just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of “family.” 
And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I 
learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into 
a home.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Living life in a country or place away can be very difficult from what I've known, heard and seen. Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally. Nonetheless, this well-told memoir tells of the contentment and good side of it all. The happiness that was created in a place that Narciso calls home. In the home, he still got to experience Cuban culture including music, traditional cooking and best of all ambiance of family being around. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote kind of lightens up the whole idea of this memoir and how people from all over came together to celebrate the wonderful joys of life even though at times they were frowned upon.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Dear [Student's Name],

Thank you for sharing your essay with me. You have touched upon some important themes and presented a thoughtful reflection on Narciso's experiences. Here are a few points of feedback based on the values I hold dear in writing:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: Your essay introduces some complex ideas, but at times it can be challenging to follow your line of thought. Try to ensure that each sentence clearly connects to the next. For instance, you might want to elaborate more on how poverty, racism, and discrimination are juxtaposed with the happiness and contentment Narciso finds in his home.

2. **Specificity and Detail**: Providing specific examples can make your essay more vivid and engaging. You mention Cuban culture, music, and traditional cooking—consider adding a few more details or anecdotes to bring these elements to life for the reader.

3. **Grammar and Syntax**: Pay attention to sentence structure and grammar. For example, the first sentence reads, ""Living life in a country or place away can be very difficult from what I've known, heard and seen."" This could be clearer if rephrased to something like, ""Living in a different country can be very challenging, as I’ve come to understand from various accounts."" Also, be mindful of subject-verb agreement and punctuation throughout your essay.

4. **Quotation Integration**: You included a powerful quote, which is great, but try to integrate it more smoothly into your essay. Explain its significance and how it ties into your overall argument. You might say, ""This quote illuminates the core of Narciso's memoir, highlighting how the warmth of family and cultural traditions can create a sense of home and joy, even in the face of external challenges.""

5. **Conclusion and Reflection**: Your essay would benefit from a stronger conclusion that ties together your main points and offers a final reflection on why Narciso’s story is significant. What can readers learn from his experience? How does it resonate with broader themes of resilience and cultural identity?

Overall, your essay has a strong foundation, and with some refinement, it can become even more impactful. Keep up the good work, and continue to think deeply about the themes you wish to explore.

Best regards,

17,57,"The essay effectively captures the mood created by the author and provides specific evidence from the memoir to support the statements made. It clearly articulates the emotions of happiness, curiosity, and sadness elicited by the narrative. However, the response occasionally deviates from the focus, such as when it wonders about the reasons behind the parents' actions, which slightly detracts from the main analysis. The grammar and spelling have several errors, including incorrect capitalization and punctuation, which interrupt the flow of the essay and reduce its overall clarity. Additionally, the vocabulary is somewhat limited and repetitive, lacking the variation necessary for a higher level of sophistication. Transitions between ideas are present but are not always smooth, making parts of the narrative feel disjointed. Overall, the essay demonstrates an understanding of the memoir, but it could benefit from more precise language use, better organization, and a stronger adherence to the central question.",57,"Your essay demonstrates a clear effort to analyze the mood created by the author in the memoir. You have identified several emotions, such as happiness, curiosity, and sadness, and supported your points with examples from the text. However, the essay would benefit greatly from improvements in several key areas to enhance clarity, coherence, and grammatical precision.

1. **Thesis Statement and Structure:** 
   - The thesis statement lacks grammatical precision and clarity. A more focused thesis would help guide your essay and make your argument more compelling. Consider rephrasing it to something more specific like: ""The memoir creates a complex mood that intertwines happiness, curiosity, and sadness, reflecting the immigrant experience of Narciso's parents.""
   - Your essay would benefit from a clearer and more logical structure. Each paragraph should begin with a topic sentence that introduces the main idea, followed by supporting details and examples from the text.

2. **Supporting Arguments:**
   - While you provide examples from the text, your analysis of these examples needs more depth. Explain how each example contributes specifically to the mood you are describing. For instance, rather than just stating that the quote made you wonder why the parents immigrated, delve into how this uncertainty contributes to the curious mood.
   - Ensure that your evidence directly supports your thesis. Some of your points are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration to clearly show the connection between the example and the mood.

3. **Language and Grammar:**
   - There are several grammatical errors and inconsistencies throughout the essay. For instance, ""Narciso mom"" should be ""Narciso's mom,"" and ""carrers"" should be ""careers"". Additionally, ensure that all names and titles are correctly capitalized.
   - Avoid using placeholders like ""@LOCATION1"" and ""@MONTH1"". These disrupt the flow and coherence of the essay. Instead, use specific names and details from the text.
   - Improve your sentence structure to enhance readability. For example, ""For example the author states that his parents had to 'start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find.'"" could be more effectively written as: ""The author illustrates the extent of their sacrifice by stating that his parents had to 'start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find.'""

4. **Vocabulary:**
   - While your vocabulary is adequate, it could be more varied and precise. Use synonyms and more descriptive words to enhance your writing and avoid repetition. For example, instead of repeatedly using ""sad,"" consider words like ""melancholic"" or ""heartbreaking"" to convey more specific emotional nuances.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Your conclusion should effectively summarize the main points of your essay and tie them back to your thesis. Currently, it feels abrupt and lacks a sense of closure. Consider summarizing the different moods you discussed and how they collectively contribute to the overall emotional impact of the memoir.

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", tells us of how @CAPS1 grew up with his parents who which immigrated from Cuba, the mood created by the author is warm & comforting.For example, the mood is comforting because, @CAPS1 speaks of how, his parents created a traditional Cuban home, out of nothing but a one bedroom apartment. @CAPS1 descrbes his life being centered around the kitchen & his parent always provideing what they could the best for him.""@CAPS1 also states ""I will always be grateful to my

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a heartfelt and detailed account of the author's upbringing in a traditional Cuban home. The narrative effectively evokes a warm and comforting mood, supported by specific examples from the memoir. However, there are several grammatical errors and inconsistencies that detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. For instance, the use of ""@CAPS1"" appears to be a placeholder or redaction, which disrupts the flow of the text and makes it difficult to follow. Additionally, there are punctuation issues, such as the use of ampersands (&) instead of ""and,"" and some sentences are overly complex or improperly structured. The organization of the essay is mostly clear, with logical progression from one idea to the next, but some transitions could be smoother. The vocabulary is somewhat varied, though there are instances of repetition and incorrect usage. Overall, while the essay is interesting and provides a vivid portrayal of the author's family life, it would benefit greatly from a thorough review to correct grammatical errors and improve sentence structure.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created in this memoir is friendship. One reason is because his parents let the door open for the peope they considered family. A quote that shows this is ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors to the many people we consider family. This shows that the mood is friendship because his parents are great friends to their family.        A second reason is the importance of friend ship. A quote that shows this is ""the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay in question demonstrates a clear effort to convey the memoir's themes of friendship and family. However, it falls short in several key areas. The thesis statement is somewhat unclear and lacks grammatical accuracy. The arguments are presented, but they lack depth and sufficient development, making the supporting evidence seem superficial. Additionally, the sentences are grammatically correct but often simplistic and repetitive, leading to a lack of complexity and variation in word choice and sentence structure. The organization of the essay is weak, with transitions and topic sentences that do not effectively guide the reader through the argument. Furthermore, there are noticeable errors in spelling and punctuation, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. To improve, the writer should focus on crafting a clear and grammatically correct thesis statement, developing arguments with greater depth and precision, and ensuring that transitions and topic sentences are logically structured and grammatically accurate. Enhanced vocabulary and varied sentence structures would also contribute to a more engaging and effective essay.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the story with  When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better.  A wave of loss so deep and

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a solid effort but struggles with clarity and structure. The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.

DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 5 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Narciso Rodriguez 
from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives 
My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a 
furnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old 
Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon 
call home. 
In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the 
Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our 
traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared 
cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking 
that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which 
I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of 
childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed 
both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. 
Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that “family” had nothing to do with 
being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, 
Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation 
prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these 
cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of 
honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their 
own kind, were clearly in need. 
Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and 
Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio 
and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not 
know my “real” grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were 
allowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and 
Rosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family 
members came and went — and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they 
were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the 
many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. 
My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the 
language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a 
better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country 
they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters 
while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were 
strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind 
of jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had 
studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, 
taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their 
children to better times drove them to endure these hard times. 
I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I’ve often told them that what 
they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I’ve often told them of 
my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I’ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in 
reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at 
such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two 
lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these 
teachings have been the basis of my life. 
It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to 
this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this 
humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not 
just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of “family.” 
And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I 
learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into 
a home.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author creates a very happy, but curious mood towards the reader. The reading made me happy for Narciso, but curious on how much his parents had to struggle to give Narciso the best life he could get. For example the author states that his parents had to ""start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find."" Back in Cuba, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso mom) had Studied chemical engineering."" This shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to @LOCATION1. This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved."" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again. The author creates a variety of different moods throught the memoir.

**Feedback:**

Dear [Student's Name],

Thank you for your thoughtful essay on the author's depiction of emotions and the struggles faced by Narciso's family. You did a commendable job of identifying the different moods created by the author and how they impacted you as a reader. Here are some specific points to consider:

1. **Mood Analysis:**
   - You have effectively highlighted the happy and curious mood created by the author's descriptions. Your understanding of how the family's sacrifices evoked these feelings is clear and insightful.

2. **Textual Evidence:**
   - You've included relevant quotations to support your points, which is excellent. However, remember to format your quotes correctly and provide proper citations if this is a requirement for your assignment.

3. **Clarity and Detail:**
   - Your essay could benefit from more detailed analysis. For example, you mention feeling curious about the parents' struggles but don't delve deeply into what specific challenges they might have faced or how this curiosity enhances the narrative.

4. **Emotion and Personal Reflection:**
   - You've done well in reflecting on how the text made you feel, particularly with the sadness evoked by the immigrants' sacrifices. Personal reflections like these add depth to your analysis.

5. **Grammar and Conventions:**
   - There are a few grammatical errors and typos that need attention. For instance, ""Narciso mom"" should be ""Narciso's mom,"" and ""throught"" should be ""throughout."" Be sure to proofread your work to catch these errors.
   - Additionally, placeholders like ""@LOCATION1"" and ""@MONTH1"" should be replaced with specific details to maintain coherence.

6. **Structure and Coherence:**
   - Your essay has a good structure, but try to ensure each paragraph flows logically into the next. Transition sentences can help connect your ideas more smoothly.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - While you hinted at the variety of moods created in the memoir, summarizing these points more explicitly in your conclusion would strengthen your essay.

Overall, you've made a strong start! Paying attention to these details will enhance the clarity and impact of your writing. Keep up the good work, and continue to explore and express your insights with confidence.

18,65,"The essay provides a clear main thesis that argues the benefits of using computers, supported by practical examples. However, the development of the arguments is somewhat simplistic and could benefit from more detailed and varied evidence. The structure is fairly organized with a basic introduction, body, and conclusion, but the transitions between ideas are not always smooth, and some points feel repetitive. The word choice is functional but lacks variety and precision, which makes the writing less engaging. Sentence structure is mostly straightforward, though occasionally mechanical, which impacts the overall flow of the essay. The essay demonstrates a good grasp of standard writing conventions, with minimal errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, contributing to its readability. Overall, while the essay is clear and practical, it could be improved by adding more depth to the arguments, enhancing the transitions, and using a more sophisticated vocabulary and varied sentence structures.",65,"Dear Student,

Thank you for your essay on the benefits of using computers. I appreciate your enthusiasm and the effort you put into detailing your points. Here are some specific suggestions to align your writing more closely with the assignment goals and improve clarity, organization, and effectiveness.

### Strengths:
1. **Clarity of Thesis**: Your thesis is clear; you state that computers offer significant benefits.
2. **Personal Examples**: You use personal experiences to support your points, which adds a relatable element to your argument.

### Areas for Improvement:

1. **Organization and Structure**:
   - **Introduction**: Your introduction should succinctly introduce your main points without unnecessary information. For example, details about your age and school, while interesting, are not crucial to your argument. 
   - **Body**: You present three main reasons why computers benefit people. However, these points would be more compelling if each were developed in separate, clearly defined paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with a topic sentence that introduces the main idea, followed by specific examples and explanations.
   - **Conclusion**: Your conclusion should summarize your main points without simply repeating them. Aim to leave a lasting impression on the reader.

2. **Content and Examples**:
   - While you provide examples, they often lack specificity and depth. For instance, when mentioning websites or statistics, ensure they are realistic and credible. Instead of generic sources like ""computers.org"", name concrete and reputable sources.
   - Strengthen your arguments by explaining how the examples directly support your thesis. For instance, explain how learning about faraway places on the internet contributes to broader knowledge and cultural understanding.

3. **Word Choice and Language**:
   - Ensure your word choice is precise and varied. Phrases like ""it allows people to talk online"" can be more effectively expressed as ""it facilitates communication with individuals across the globe.""
   - Avoid repetition, such as ""learn about faraway places and people,"" which appears multiple times without variation.

4. **Sentence Fluency**:
   - Your sentences can be more varied in structure to improve the flow. Instead of using ""for example"" repeatedly, try alternative transitions like ""additionally"" or ""in a similar way.""
   - Avoid run-on sentences. Break them into smaller, more manageable parts to enhance readability.

5. **Conventions**:
   - Pay attention to grammar, punctuation, and capitalization. There are several areas where these could be improved, such as ensuring proper noun capitalization (e.g., ""Facebook"" instead of ""facebook"") and correcting spelling errors (""alot"" should be ""a lot"").

### Revised Example:
Here’s a revised example to illustrate these suggestions:

**Original**: ""I am a really smart kid. In @CAPS1 opinion I benefit people using computers.""

**Revised**: ""I believe that my use of computers offers various benefits to myself and others.""

**Original**: ""For example when I am always using","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear editor, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I believe that computers are a benefit to the world, and people as well. I say this because lots of people can talk to family of friends long distance. Also the computer can teach you lots of thing. Finally it makes you more social. In @CAPS1 strong opinion computers are better for the world. Firstly, many people can talk long distance with family of friends. You have web cam and that allows you to chat and see the person. Also @CAPS2 is another site

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and relevant thesis statement regarding the benefits of computers, and the main ideas are adequately supported with examples. However, the arguments could benefit from more specific real-world examples and pragmatic reasoning to strengthen the claims. The essay is organized with an introduction, body, and conclusion, but the transitions between paragraphs and the overall flow could be improved for a smoother reading experience. The word choice is mostly effective, conveying the intended message clearly, although some phrases lack precision and could be refined for better clarity. The sentence structures are varied but could be more fluid to enhance readability. There are minimal errors in conventions, but attention to correct usage of punctuation, spelling, and capitalization would improve the overall quality. Overall, the essay is clear and focused, but it could be enhanced with better organization, more precise language, and stronger examples to fully meet the teacher's expectations for clarity, practicality, and linguistic precision.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear Newspaper editor I would like to make @CAPS3 about the benifits of owning a computer. For example you can learn many thing you would of never of been able too, you can also go in chat rooms and talk with friends or other people and it can even make teaching esyer too. Computers in many countres are standard and we use then to learn many things but if you bring one to the tribes in @LOCATION1 it will look like a alein object but once they know how to use it it can open there eyes for ever

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay you presented demonstrates a genuine enthusiasm for the topic of the benefits of owning a computer, but it requires significant refinement in several areas to meet higher standards. The content is somewhat clear and addresses the prompt, though the examples provided are often broad and lack depth in real-world relevance. Incorporating more specific, illustrative examples would enhance the argument's effectiveness. The organization of the essay is somewhat disjointed, with ideas jumping from one to another without clear transitions or a logical flow. Improving the structure by using well-defined topic sentences and coherent transitions between paragraphs would help. 

In terms of word choice, the essay frequently uses casual and imprecise language, which detracts from its persuasive power. Employing a more formal and precise vocabulary would improve readability and impact. Sentence fluency is also an issue; many sentences are awkwardly constructed and run-on, making the essay difficult to follow at times. Simplifying sentence structures and varying them would help create a smoother reading experience. Finally, conventions are a major area for improvement. The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, incorrect spelling, and improper punctuation, all of which impede readability and distract from the argument. A thorough proofreading to correct these mistakes is essential. Overall, while the essay shows promise in engaging with the topic, it needs significant work in clarity, structure, language precision, and grammatical accuracy to fully persuade the reader.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear local newspaper, I am writing this letter to you to show on how people get effected from computers. It effects people very well and teaches people many things for just one technology. Computers effects many people for what it does. Computers have many advantages that people learn very quickly. Many people love computers. It is one of the most best inventions to everyone around the world. They teach positive things for people to learn. Computer even have a positive effect on people across

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear stance on the positive effects of computers but lacks depth and specificity in its arguments. The thesis is somewhat ambiguous and repetitive, which diminishes its overall clarity and impact. There is an attempt to develop and support the thesis, but the examples provided are general and unconvincing. For instance, the discussion on hand-eye coordination is not thoroughly explained or supported with concrete evidence. The organization of the essay is basic, with a discernible introduction, body, and conclusion; however, the flow of ideas is somewhat disjointed and lacks smooth transitions. The language used is simplistic and at times redundant, which affects the precision and engagement of the writing. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors and awkward sentence constructions that impede readability. To strengthen the essay, it would benefit from a more precise thesis, richer and more specific examples, improved coherence, and careful attention to language and stylistic choices. Overall, the essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the topic but requires significant refinement to meet the teacher's expectations for clarity, practicality, and precision.

DOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 1 
Prompt 
More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those
who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people.
They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and
people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas.
Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and
less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. 
Write a letter to your local newspaper in which you state your opinion on the effects
computers have on people. Persuade the readers to agree with you.

TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Dear [Student's Name],

Thank you for your essay submission. I can see that you have put effort into expressing your thoughts on how computers benefit people, and I appreciate your enthusiasm about the subject. Here are some constructive points to help improve your writing:

1. **Structure and Organization**:
   - Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Consider breaking it into distinct paragraphs for each of your reasons. Start with an introduction, followed by separate paragraphs for each reason, and end with a conclusion.
   - Ensure each paragraph starts with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea of that paragraph.

2. **Clarity and Specificity**:
   - Instead of using placeholders like @CAPS1, @NUM1, @ORGANIZATION1, etc., use specific names, places, and numbers. This will make your essay more personal and easier to understand.
   - Be specific about the sources you mention. For example, name the TV channel or website you refer to, and provide accurate statistics if possible.

3. **Grammar and Punctuation**:
   - Pay attention to grammar and punctuation to make your writing clearer. For example, ""In my opinion, I benefit people using computers"" should include a comma.
   - Avoid run-on sentences. Break long sentences into shorter, more manageable ones.
   - Ensure subject-verb agreement. For example, ""they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability…” should be ""they teach hand-eye coordination and give people the ability…""

4. **Examples and Evidence**:
   - Provide clear and relevant examples to support your points. For instance, instead of saying ""for example, when I am always using the computer…,"" specify a particular instance or project where the computer helped you.

5. **Coherence and Flow**:
   - Ensure your essay flows smoothly from one point to the next. Transitional phrases can help guide the reader through your argument.
   - Reiterate your main points in the conclusion to reinforce your argument, but avoid simply repeating the same phrases.

6. **Tone and Persuasiveness**:
   - While it’s good to be confident, stating ""I am a really smart kid"" might come across as boastful. Focus on presenting your points clearly and let the reader conclude your intelligence from the quality of your writing.
   - Make your conclusion compelling. Instead of saying ""please try to make this believable,"" summarize why your points are strong and well-supported.

Here’s a revised version of your introduction to serve as an example:

---

Dear Local Newspaper,

My name is [Your Name]. I am [Your Age] years old and I attend [Your School Name] in [Your Location]. I believe that I benefit people by using computers, and I would like to share with you three compelling reasons why. Firstly, computers enhance hand-eye coordination and provide opportunities to learn about distant places and people. Secondly, they enable communication with others online. Lastly, they are invaluable tools for students",0.9162547852852696,0.9067237654738104
19,67,"The essay presents a clear and relevant thesis, emphasizing the balance between personal rights and the protection of youth in the context of censorship. The arguments are well-developed, supported with historical references and hypothetical scenarios that effectively illustrate the potential consequences of censorship. However, the essay would benefit from stronger real-world examples to enhance its persuasiveness. The organization is logical, with coherent transitions and well-defined topic sentences that guide the reader through the argument. The language and style are practical and appropriate, using suitable vocabulary and straightforward sentence structures that convey the intended message effectively. There is a smooth flow to the writing, although occasional awkward constructions could be refined for better readability. The essay demonstrates control over standard writing conventions, though minor errors in spelling and grammar are present and should be corrected to improve the overall quality. Overall, the essay is clear, practical, and relevant, aligning well with the teacher's values of clarity, practicality, real-world relevance, and linguistic precision.",67,"### Feedback:

**Content and Argumentation:**
Your essay provides a compelling argument against censorship, highlighting the potential dangers and historical misuses of such policies, while also addressing the need to protect young minds. This is a strong foundation for your persuasive piece. However, to enhance your argument further, it would be beneficial to include more concrete examples and real-world scenarios. For instance, citing specific instances where censorship has led to negative societal impacts or referring to well-known cases of book banning can help support your claims and make your argument more persuasive.

**Organization:**
Your essay is generally well-structured, with clear sections that address different aspects of your argument. However, some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to help maintain the flow of your ideas. For example, the transition between your discussion on personal rights and the historical misuse of censorship could be strengthened by a linking sentence that highlights the connection between individual freedoms and historical abuses.

**Thesis and Conclusion:**
Your thesis is stated clearly in the introduction, and you return to it effectively in your conclusion, reinforcing your main points. However, consider rephrasing your concluding statement to make it more impactful. Instead of ""Therefore, why censor,"" you might say, ""Therefore, censorship in any form should be avoided to preserve individual freedoms and historical integrity, except in cases where it is necessary to protect children.""

**Word Choice and Sentence Fluency:**
Your word choice is mostly effective, but there are a few areas where clarity could be improved. For instance, ""perrogative"" should be corrected to ""prerogative."" Additionally, varying your sentence structure can help maintain the reader's interest. For example, instead of the repetitive structure in ""a certain book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad,"" consider rephrasing to add variety and emphasis.

**Conventions:**
There are a few grammatical and spelling errors that need attention. Words like ""arguement"" should be corrected to ""argument,"" and ""ceratin"" to ""certain."" Additionally, ensure that all sentences are complete and correctly punctuated, as there are a few instances of run-on sentences that could be broken down for better readability.

**Actionable Suggestions:**
1. Incorporate specific historical and contemporary examples to strengthen your argument.
2. Improve transitions between paragraphs to ensure a smoother flow of ideas.
3. Vary sentence structures to maintain reader engagement.
4. Proofread your essay for spelling and grammatical errors to enhance clarity and professionalism.
5. Rephrase your concluding sentence for a stronger impact.

Overall, you have a solid argument and a clear stance on the issue of censorship. With a few adjustments and refinements, your essay can become even more persuasive and impactful. Keep up the good work and continue to build on these strong foundations.","

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: There should not be a certain kinds of books in the library. Books should not be tooken off the shelf just because some people find them offensive. Do not get the book, other people might like it, its just for entertainment.     If you do not like the book do not have to get the book. While looking for a book if there is one that does not seem right just look past. It will not even be a bother. There is a lot of books in the library, just find a different book instead of just focusing on that

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to address the topic of censorship in libraries; however, it lacks clarity and depth in its arguments. The main ideas are overly broad and repetitive, failing to engage the reader or provide strong support for the thesis. The essay's organization is weak, with a loose structure that lacks clear transitions and well-defined topic sentences, making it challenging to follow the author's train of thought. The word choice is often inappropriate and imprecise, using informal and incorrect terms such as ""tooken."" The sentence fluency is mechanical, with awkward constructions that impede readability. Furthermore, the essay contains several grammatical errors, including incorrect verb tense and punctuation issues, which detract from its overall effectiveness. To improve, the author should focus on developing a clear, concise thesis and supporting it with relevant, well-organized arguments and real-world examples. Additionally, attention should be given to refining sentence structure and word choice, as well as proofreading for grammatical accuracy.

off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then
you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books
left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, Author 
Write a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your views on censorship in libraries.
Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,
should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position
with convincing arguments from your own experience, observations, and/or reading.

occasional lapses in stylistic control; dialogue, if used, sounds natural for the
most part, but may at times sound stilted or unnatural. 
Score
3:
The
writing tends to be mechanical rather than fluid. Occasional awkward
constructions may force the reader to slow down or reread. The writing is characterized by

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Does censorship solve any problems?  If one person wants to censor something in a library, there is bound to be another person on the other side of that arguement  trying to protect that work from be taken away.  As a free country, it is every individuals right to take in whatever form of literature or music that they find pleasing, and history has shown the world that censorship leads those in power down a dark road.  The shielding of offensive materials is only necessary and fair when the young, impressionable minds of the world's youth are at stake, but once a person is old enough to make informed decisions, it should be their perrogative to choose their own material.  Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history, but necessary when protecting the young.     It is a person's right to choose what kind of literature they would like to read.  If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned.  For example take a hypothetical public library: a public library is an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music.  A great mental image of serenity and peace.  How does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves?  Suddenly right and left, books are disappearing as if by magic: a ceratin book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad.  Before long, there are not very many books left in this hypothetical library other than books for toddlers.  With this system, everyone suffers.  Everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to.  It would all just be simpler if book were just not banned from libraries.     History has given the world many a cruel dictator.  Oftentimes, once he comes to power, he is not the most popular of governmental forms.  To keep his subjects underneath his rule, often he has to resort to taking away civil rights.  This could be a curfew, fake elections, or censorship.  If the ruler has the power of censorship, he or she can control what the public thinks, feels, and believes.  With this power over them, the people are weakened and often abused.  Now imagine that censorship occuring in a country that has civil rights.  People would not stand for it.  So why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom?  There is absolutely no need for censorship to occur, and as history has shown, it certainly is not a good thing.     Censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights.  There is, however, one other element at play here: protection of youth and innocence.  Almost everyone can remember a time a child when they were young and innocent, free of worry and trouble.  That can disappear in a instant.  Children should not be exposed to things that are innappropriate for their age.  Nearly every movie nowadays has violent and risque, if not full-blown-adult, materials present in it.  The age of innocence is getting younger every generation, and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point.  A claim like this @MONTH1 sound hypotcritical coming from the mouth of one against censorship, but it is not 'censorship' when one is protecting the young.      Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children.  It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon.  The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people.  Also, children should be protected, and that is not censorship.  Censorship solves no problems, but it makes everyone unhappy.  Therefore, why censor
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","**Feedback:**

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Stance**: Your essay has a clear stance on the issue of censorship. You effectively argue against censorship while acknowledging the need to protect young, impressionable minds.
2. **Historical Context**: You provide historical context and examples to support your argument, which strengthens your position.
3. **Imagery and Examples**: The use of a hypothetical public library to illustrate your point is effective. It helps the reader visualize the consequences of censorship.
4. **Structure**: Your essay has a logical structure, with distinct sections for different points of your argument.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Spelling and Grammar**: There are several spelling and grammatical errors that need to be addressed. For example, ""arguement"" should be ""argument,"" ""perrogative"" should be ""prerogative,"" and ""ceratin"" should be ""certain.""
2. **Clarity and Conciseness**: Some sentences are a bit long and convoluted. Try to break them down into shorter, clearer sentences. For instance, ""If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned"" could be simplified for clarity.
3. **Consistency**: Ensure that your argument is consistent throughout. At times, the essay seems to waver, particularly in the section about protecting children. Clarify that while you oppose censorship for adults, you support age-appropriate restrictions for children.
4. **Transition and Flow**: Improve the transitions between paragraphs to ensure a smoother flow of ideas. Currently, some sections feel disjointed.
5. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion should be more definitive and concise. It currently feels a bit repetitive. Summarize your main points clearly and end with a strong statement.
6. **Error in Placeholder**: There is a placeholder ""@MONTH1"" that seems out of place and needs correction.

**Specific Suggestions:**
1. **Introduction**: Start with a more engaging hook to capture the reader's attention.
2. **Examples**: While your historical context is valuable, you could also include recent examples to make your argument more relatable to contemporary readers.
3. **Balancing Act**: While you argue against censorship, ensure you also emphasize the importance of diverse viewpoints and intellectual freedom.

**Revised Excerpt for Clarity:**
""Imagine a hypothetical public library: an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music. This serene image is shattered once books begin disappearing from the shelves.

20,70,"The essay demonstrates a minimal attempt at addressing the prompt, with several areas requiring significant improvement. The thesis and main ideas lack clarity and coherence, making it difficult for the reader to grasp the writer's central argument. The essay's content is underdeveloped, with few specific examples from Joe Kurmaskie's essay to support the points made. The language and spelling exhibit numerous errors, including incorrect word choices and grammatical mistakes, which detract from the overall readability and impact. Organizationally, the essay is disjointed, lacking clear transitions and well-defined topic sentences, resulting in a fragmented flow of ideas. The essay could benefit from a thorough revision to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness, ensuring that it adheres more closely to the prompt and includes well-supported, relevant examples from the memoir.",70,"Your essay demonstrates a good starting point in addressing how the setting affects the cyclist. You've identified several key moments from Joe Kurmaskie's story, such as encountering the ghost town and the harsh desert terrain, which are crucial elements that impact the cyclist's journey. Here are some specific points to help you refine and improve your essay:

1. **Thesis Clarity**:
   - **Current Sentence**: ""Certin features of the setting affected the cyclist.""
   - **Improvement**: Your opening statement is a bit vague. It would be more effective to clearly state how these features specifically impacted the cyclist. For example, you might say, ""The harsh and desolate features of the setting, such as the ghost town and the relentless sun, significantly challenged the cyclist both physically and mentally.""

2. **Supporting Details and Specificity**:
   - **Current Sentence**: ""In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes he’s experiences when he cycled through the desert.""
   - **Improvement**: This sentence could be more precise. Try: ""Joe Kurmaskie describes his grueling experiences cycling through the unforgiving desert terrain.""
   - **Current Sentence**: ""'...arrived at the first town'...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town.""
   - **Improvement**: Include the full context to make the quote more meaningful. For example: ""Kurmaskie arrives at what he expected to be a thriving town, only to find a ghost town, underscoring the isolation and desolation of his journey.""

3. **Logical Flow and Transitions**:
   - Your essay has some good ideas, but the transitions between them are abrupt. For example, you jump from discussing the ghost town to a quote about the cruelty of life without a clear connection.
   - **Improvement**: Use transitional phrases to guide the reader. For example, ""As he continues his journey, the initial amusement fades, and the harsh reality sets in as he states, 'sometimes life can be so cruel.'""

4. **Grammar and Spelling**:
   - **Current Issues**: There are several spelling errors such as ""Certin"" (certain), ""desribes"" (describes), ""hes"" (his), ""difinition"" (definition), ""scketle"" (skeptical), ""untill"" (until), ""aroun"" (around), ""son"" (sun), and ""soluation"" (solution).
   - **Improvement**: Proofread your essay to correct these errors. Use tools like spell check or ask a peer to review your work.

5. **Practical Language**:
   - **Current Sentence**: ""All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water.""
   - **Improvement**: ""Surrounded by barren hills under the scorching sun with limited water, the","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Rolling hills, open terran, hgh deserts-all are features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic response to the prompt by discussing how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, focusing on rolling hills, open terrain, and high deserts. However, it lacks depth and specificity in its supporting details, which limits the clarity and persuasiveness of the arguments. The writer uses some real-world examples but does not fully develop them to support their points effectively. The narrative follows a logical sequence, but transitions between ideas are somewhat abrupt, making the flow less smooth. While the language is generally clear and functional, it shows occasional errors in spelling and grammar, such as ""terran,"" ""hgh,"" and ""mles,"" which detract from the overall readability. Improving the essay would involve elaborating on the points with more detailed and specific examples, enhancing the transitions between ideas for better coherence, and carefully proofreading to correct grammatical errors.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay lacks clarity and practical relevance, making it difficult for the reader to follow the main points. The thesis is neither clear nor well-developed, leaving the intent and purpose of the essay ambiguous. The arguments are simplistic and not supported by real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning, which diminishes their impact. The conclusion is ineffective and fails to reinforce the thesis with practical implications. The organizational structure is weak, with ideas that are not coherently presented or logically connected through clear transitions and defined topic sentences. In terms of language and style, the essay employs a limited vocabulary, with word choices that are often inappropriate for the context, and sentence structures that are awkward and disjointed. The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which further impedes readability and detracts from the essay's overall quality. To improve, the essay needs a clear thesis, well-supported arguments with real-world examples, a logical structure with coherent transitions, appropriate and varied vocabulary, and meticulous attention to grammatical conventions.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The arhuror concludes this story with this paragraph to show people that the story or people in the story have a thing for nature or like writing about nature like whats in nature the change or maybe this story is about nature at its best.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is quite disorganized and lacks clarity and practical focus. The thesis is unclear, and the content is not developed with concrete, real-world evidence or pragmatic reasoning. The argument about the story and nature is repetitive and vague, leaving the reader without a clear understanding of the author's point. Additionally, the conclusion does not effectively reinforce the thesis or provide practical implications. Structurally, the essay falls short of the expected standards. It lacks a coherent organization, with no clear introduction, body, or conclusion. Transitions between ideas are absent, making the essay difficult to follow. The language and style used are inappropriate for the audience and purpose; there are numerous grammatical errors, misspellings, and issues with punctuation and capitalization. Words are often misused, which further obscures the intended meaning. Overall, the essay needs significant revision to improve clarity, practicality, structure, and adherence to standard writing conventions.

evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn’t have done was 
let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice 
and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to 
Yosemite National Park. 
They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I 
would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with 
strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town.” 
This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time—say, before the last world war—but 
on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water 
supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool 
pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. 
Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, 
and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had 
been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of 
California in June. 
I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my 
strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the 
neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water 
wouldn’t cool down. It didn’t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. 
The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make 
that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so—a test of my inner spirit. 
Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was 
replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign 
jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. 
The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so 
cruel. 
I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it 
really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased 
past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. 
The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my 
shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June 
simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, 
caused me to laugh. 
It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. 
There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride 
down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d 
be fine. 
Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make 
sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst 
of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. 
In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building—abandoned years 
earlier, by the looks of it—had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A 
sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still 
be seen. 
I hung my head. 
That smoky blues tune “Summertime” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating 
brain. 
I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. 
I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you 
have left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. 
It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some 
expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and 
their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I 
was going to lose consciousness for the last time. 
Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining 
elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear 
were all behind me. 
GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP—IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE 
YOUR BEST BET! 
“And the only bet,” I remember thinking. 
As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an 
overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait—any bait, even 
though I didn’t own a rod or reel. 
An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from 
my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. 
“Where you headed in such a hurry?” 
“Yosemite,” I whispered. 
“Know the best way to get there?” 
I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group 
I’d listened to in Lodi. 
“Yes, sir! I own a very good map.” 
And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Certin features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes hes experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town. ''at first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little scketle at it because the old codgers  told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel. Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men.        
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Certainly! Here is the feedback based on the values of clarity, coherence, grammar, and content:

---

**Feedback:**

**1. Clarity and Coherence:** 
Your essay provides an interesting summary of Joe Kurmaskie's experience cycling through the desert. However, some parts of your essay could be clearer and more coherent. Try to connect your ideas more smoothly and provide a consistent flow of thought. For example, adding transition words and rephrasing certain sentences will help the reader follow your narrative better.

**2. Grammar and Spelling:**
There are several grammatical errors and misspelled words that need correction. Here are some specific points:
- ""Certin"" should be ""Certain.""
- ""desribes"" should be ""describes.""
- ""hes"" should be ""his.""
- ""difinition"" should be ""definition.""
- ""scketle"" should be ""skeptical.""
- ""untill"" should be ""until.""
- ""aroun"" should be ""around.""
- ""sorching son"" should be ""scorching sun.""
- ""soluation"" should be ""solace.""

**3. Sentence Structure:**
Some of your sentences are fragmented or awkwardly structured. For instance, instead of ""he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end,"" you might write, ""he still had a long way to go until he reached the park, and he felt as if the journey would never end."" This improves readability.

**4. Content:**
You have captured the essence of the cyclist’s experience well, but adding more detail and analysis would strengthen your essay. For example, why does the cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from the older men? How does the setting specifically impact his journey and mental state? Delving deeper into these aspects will make your essay more insightful.

**5. Quotations and References:**
When including quotes from the text, ensure they are correctly integrated and punctuated. For example, instead of ""...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town,"" you could write, ""He 'arrived at the first town' and noticed that 'it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.'""

**6. Formatting:**
Ensure your essay is properly formatted. Indenting paragraphs and using appropriate punctuation will enhance readability.

---

**Revised Example:**

Certain features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist. In Joe Kurmaskie's essay, he describes his experiences cycling through the desert. When he ""arrived at the first town,"" he noticed that ""it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" Initially, the cyclist found this amusing and perhaps was a bit skeptical because the older men had described it as thriving. Halfway through his journey, he stated, ""sometimes life can be so cruel."" With water running low and still a long way to go",0.8592831920274451,0.8860303251590247
21,71,"The essay demonstrates some effort to address how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, but it falls short in several critical areas. The thesis and overall argument are somewhat unclear, making it difficult to follow the main ideas. The essay does touch on various aspects of the setting, such as the sun, ghost towns, obstacles, and terrain, but these points are often presented without enough detail or real-world examples to support them effectively. Additionally, the essay lacks coherence and logical transitions between sentences and paragraphs, making it feel fragmented and disjointed. The language is imprecise, with numerous grammatical errors, awkward sentence constructions, and inappropriate word choices that detract from readability. These issues also impede the flow and make the narrative challenging to follow. Overall, the essay shows minimal control of standard writing conventions, and the frequent errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization further undermine the clarity and impact of the writing. To improve, the essay needs a clearer thesis, more detailed and well-supported arguments, better organization, and significant attention to language and grammar.",71,"**Feedback:**

Your essay demonstrates a good attempt at identifying key features of the setting that affect the cyclist. You've made a strong effort to pull specific details from the source text, such as the ""sun beginning to heat down"" and ""run down ghost towns,"" which shows your understanding of the prompt. Here are some areas where you can improve to meet the goals and criteria for success:

1. **Clarity and Specificity**:
   - Your points are clear but need more specificity and elaboration to strengthen your arguments. For instance, when discussing the sun's effect, you mention that it made the cyclist ""hot and thirsty."" Enhance this by explaining how this affects his endurance and decision-making during the ride.

2. **Logical Organization and Coherence**:
   - Your essay would benefit from a more logical organization. Start with a clear thesis statement that outlines the main features you will discuss. Group related ideas together and use transitional phrases to connect them smoothly. For example, you could start with the sun's impact, then move on to the ghost towns, followed by obstacles on the road, and finally, the challenging terrain.

3. **Grammar and Spelling**:
   - There are noticeable errors that impede the readability of your essay. Phrases like ""THIRSTY-NESS REDUFROM HIM"" and ""THEY DIN'T HAVE ANY WATCH FOR THEM TO FEEL UP WITH"" need correction. Proofreading your work or using grammar-check tools can help you catch and correct these errors.

4. **Practical Language and Real-World Examples**:
   - Aim to use practical language that is easy to understand. For example, instead of ""SUMMER THE HELL,"" you might say ""climb the steep hill."" Also, when mentioning obstacles like tumbleweeds and snakes, elaborate on how these specific challenges affect a cyclist in real-world scenarios—this will make your essay more engaging and relatable.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Ensure that your essay has a strong conclusion that ties back to your thesis and summarizes the main points. Reinforce how these features collectively impact the cyclist's journey, emphasizing the practical implications of each.

Here’s a revised version of your introduction to illustrate these points:

**Revised Introduction:**

""The setting presents numerous challenges that significantly affect the cyclist's journey. One prominent feature is the relentless sun, which not only makes the cyclist hot and thirsty but also forces him to deplete his limited water supply, putting his endurance to the test. Additionally, the desolate ghost towns, with their ramshackle sheds and rusty pumps, contribute to the cyclist's sense of hopelessness and dehydration. Obstacles such as tumbleweeds and pavement-blocking snakes further complicate his progress, slowing him down to a mere 12 mph. Lastly, the long, steep hills exhaust the cyclist, draining his energy as he struggles to navigate the harsh terrain.""

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Rolling hills, open terran, hgh deserts-all are features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic response to the prompt by discussing how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, focusing on rolling hills, open terrain, and high deserts. However, it lacks depth and specificity in its supporting details, which limits the clarity and persuasiveness of the arguments. The writer uses some real-world examples but does not fully develop them to support their points effectively. The narrative follows a logical sequence, but transitions between ideas are somewhat abrupt, making the flow less smooth. While the language is generally clear and functional, it shows occasional errors in spelling and grammar, such as ""terran,"" ""hgh,"" and ""mles,"" which detract from the overall readability. Improving the essay would involve elaborating on the points with more detailed and specific examples, enhancing the transitions between ideas for better coherence, and carefully proofreading to correct grammatical errors.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay lacks clarity and practical relevance, making it difficult for the reader to follow the main points. The thesis is neither clear nor well-developed, leaving the intent and purpose of the essay ambiguous. The arguments are simplistic and not supported by real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning, which diminishes their impact. The conclusion is ineffective and fails to reinforce the thesis with practical implications. The organizational structure is weak, with ideas that are not coherently presented or logically connected through clear transitions and defined topic sentences. In terms of language and style, the essay employs a limited vocabulary, with word choices that are often inappropriate for the context, and sentence structures that are awkward and disjointed. The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which further impedes readability and detracts from the essay's overall quality. To improve, the essay needs a clear thesis, well-supported arguments with real-world examples, a logical structure with coherent transitions, appropriate and varied vocabulary, and meticulous attention to grammatical conventions.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The arhuror concludes this story with this paragraph to show people that the story or people in the story have a thing for nature or like writing about nature like whats in nature the change or maybe this story is about nature at its best.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is quite disorganized and lacks clarity and practical focus. The thesis is unclear, and the content is not developed with concrete, real-world evidence or pragmatic reasoning. The argument about the story and nature is repetitive and vague, leaving the reader without a clear understanding of the author's point. Additionally, the conclusion does not effectively reinforce the thesis or provide practical implications. Structurally, the essay falls short of the expected standards. It lacks a coherent organization, with no clear introduction, body, or conclusion. Transitions between ideas are absent, making the essay difficult to follow. The language and style used are inappropriate for the audience and purpose; there are numerous grammatical errors, misspellings, and issues with punctuation and capitalization. Words are often misused, which further obscures the intended meaning. Overall, the essay needs significant revision to improve clarity, practicality, structure, and adherence to standard writing conventions.

DOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit 
by Joe Kurmaskie 
FORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece 
of advice for the solo cyclist would be, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers 
who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” It’s not that a group of 
old guys doesn’t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid 
place. Things change.

TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for your effort in writing this essay. You've identified several key features in the setting that impact the cyclist, and your ideas show a clear understanding of how the environment can influence someone's experience. Here are some suggestions for improvement to help you refine your writing:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: Your essay would benefit from clearer and more coherent sentences. For instance, instead of ""THE SUN BEGINNING TO HEAT DOWN,"" you could say, ""The sun was beating down."" This makes your point clearer and more concise.

2. **Grammar and Sentence Structure**: Pay attention to grammar and sentence structure. For example, ""THE THIRSTY-NESS REDUFROM HIM TO USE HIS LIMITED SUPPLY OF WATER"" should be ""The thirst forced him to use his limited supply of water."" Additionally, ""ANOTHER FEATURE THAT CAUSED SOME PROBLEMS FOR THE CYCLIST WERE THE RUN DOWN GHOST TOWNS"" should be ""Another feature that caused problems for the cyclist was the run-down ghost towns.""

3. **Consistency in Tense**: Ensure that you maintain a consistent tense throughout your essay. For example, ""OBSTACLES SUCH AS TUMBLEWEEDS AND PAVEMENT BLOCKING SNAKES ALSO PLAYS"" should be ""Obstacles such as tumbleweeds and pavement-blocking snakes also played.""

4. **Detail and Explanation**: Some parts of your essay are unclear due to missing or incorrect words. For example, ""FEEL UP WITH AS HE BECAME DEHYDRATED"" could be rephrased to ""refill his water supply, leading to dehydration."" Ensure each sentence is complete and fully explains your point.

5. **Quotation Marks and Capitalization**: Use quotation marks and capitalization appropriately. For example, ""RUN DOWN GHOST TOWNS"" should be ""run-down 'ghost towns'."" Also, avoid using all caps, as it can be distracting.

6. **Conclusion**: Your last sentence appears incomplete: ""HE USES MUCH ENERGY TO SUMMER THE HELL, HE WAS ??? ???? ??? ???"" Make sure to complete your thoughts and provide a clear conclusion.

Revised Version:
The setting has several features that affect the cyclist in various ways. One feature is the sun beating down, which makes the cyclist hot and thirsty, forcing him to use his limited supply of water. The sun, therefore, impacts him both physically and resource-wise. Another problematic feature is the run-down ghost towns, consisting of ramshackle sheds and several rusty pumps. These sights lead the cyclist to feel hopeless, especially since there is no water available, causing dehydration. 

Obstacles such as tumbleweeds and pavement-blocking snakes also play a role in hindering the cyclist's progress on the road, making him slow down to just 12 mph. Finally, the terrain itself poses a significant challenge. A long, sloping",0.9453190518772223,0.9364119193511067

The thesis is unclear and the arguments are undeveloped, lacking any real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning to support the points being made.

In essence, the essay requires substantial improvements in clarity, content, organization, and linguistic precision to meet the standards expected by the teacher.",75,"Thank you for your effort on this essay. I appreciate that you have attempted to understand and explain why the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph. However, there are several areas where you can improve to meet the criteria for success.

1. **Content and Prompt Adherence:**
   - Your response identifies the concluding paragraph but lacks sufficient depth in explaining its significance. To improve, focus on elaborating why the blossoming of the hibiscus is important to Saeng and how it symbolizes her readiness to try again.
   - You should include more details and examples from the story to support your points. For instance, refer to how the hibiscus and other plants remind Saeng of her past and her heritage, and how this connection gives her hope and strength.

2. **Language and Grammar:**
   - Pay attention to the clarity and coherence of your sentences. For example, instead of saying ""I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started,"" you could write, ""The author concludes the story with this paragraph to signify Saeng's determination to try again when the hibiscus blooms, representing a fresh start.""
   - Ensure correct use of grammar and punctuation. For example, ""hibiscus is building"" should be ""hibiscus is budding.""

3. **Organization and Structure:**
   - Your essay needs a clearer structure, including an introduction that states your thesis, body paragraphs that expand on your points with supporting details, and a conclusion that reinforces your main argument.
   - Use transitional phrases to help your essay flow more smoothly. For example, you can start with ""The author concludes the story with this paragraph because..."" and then elaborate with ""This is evident when Saeng mentions...""

4. **Narrativity:**
   - Make your response more engaging by clearly linking your analysis back to Saeng's experiences and emotions. Describe the connection between the hibiscus blooming and Saeng's personal growth and determination.
   - Use more varied vocabulary to keep the reader interested. Instead of repeating ""I think,"" try different expressions like ""It appears,"" ""It suggests,"" or ""This implies.""

**Revised Example:**
""The author concludes the story with this paragraph to highlight Saeng's resolve to overcome her challenges. The blooming hibiscus symbolizes renewal and hope, mirroring Saeng's determination to succeed. This is evident when Saeng vows, 'In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.' This statement illustrates her readiness to embrace new beginnings and face her obstacles with renewed vigor.""

By focusing on these areas, you can improve the clarity, coherence, and depth of your analysis. Keep practicing and don't hesitate to ask questions if you need further clarification. You're on the right track!","

DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus 
by Minfong Ho 
Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng
walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist
shop to see if the plant can be purchased. 
It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat
leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in
seemingly random profusion. 
“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy
potted plant by the corner. 
There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals
splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of
recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 
“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. 
A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with
vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into
the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the
bucket. 
Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,
oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had
not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. 
When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and
cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel. 
And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with
purplish petals and white centers. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced. How strange to
see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick
walls or between tiled roofs. 
And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and
found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.
“Dok Malik,” she said,
savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its
tag, “jasmine.” 
One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed
her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could
almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she
combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng
would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. 
Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm
around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed
comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? 
A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a
channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. 
And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. 
It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the
last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.
As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of
the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to
her. 
Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. “Ghup ma laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully.
“Goodness, it’s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?” Then she noticed
the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. 
Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. “Where
did you get it?” 
“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question. 
“How much?” 
For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. 
“That’s all?” Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the 
Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .” 
“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said. 
“Then what else—?” 
“Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” 
“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously. “But how could you? All the seeds for this
vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed
the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. 
“What happened?” she asked, more gently. 
“I—I failed the test,” Saeng said. 
For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the
eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. 
Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng’s hands. “It’s a beautiful
plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.” 
“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. 
“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the
words at home, lest she burst into tears again. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said. 
“I know,” her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t
as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.
That’s what matters.” 
She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her
other hand. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said. “Let’s plant it, right now.” 
She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The
soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair
trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There
was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. 
“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. 
Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and
start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?” 
“I’d love it,” Saeng said. 
Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.
She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,
the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth
watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not
even Mrs. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.
But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. 
The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.
Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng
now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange
before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her
now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against
the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. 
When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the
geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started. I think that is why because she says In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay. Here are some observations and suggestions to help improve your writing:

1. **Clarify Your Thesis**: Your concluding statement provides an interpretation of the story, which is a great start. However, it would be beneficial to clearly state your thesis at the beginning of your essay. This will help set the stage for your analysis and make your argument more coherent.

2. **Quotation Integration**: When you include a quote from the text, make sure to integrate it smoothly into your own writing. Currently, the quote feels somewhat separate from your analysis. You can frame it more effectively by introducing the quote and explaining its significance in your own words.

3. **Grammar and Syntax**: There are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrases, such as ""The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say..."" and “I think that is why because she says..."" Rephrasing these sentences will enhance readability. For instance, you could say, ""I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate that...""

4. **Be Specific**: It's important to be clear and specific in your analysis. Instead of saying ""I think,” you could use more assertive language like ""The author intends to convey…” This will make your argument stronger and more persuasive.

5. **Expand Your Analysis**: While your essay touches on the conclusion of the story, expanding your analysis to include more details and examples from the text will strengthen your argument. Try to explain why the return of the hibiscus and the changing seasons are significant symbols in the context of the story.

6. **Proofread**: Finally, always proofread your work for spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors. This will ensure that your writing is polished and professional.

Here's a revised version of your paragraph to illustrate these points:

""The author concludes the story with the final paragraph to illustrate the cyclical nature of the protagonist's journey. When the hibiscus starts to grow back, it symbolizes a return to the beginning, suggesting that the protagonist will have another opportunity to face her challenges. This is evident when she states, 'In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.' This line indicates that the protagonist is hopeful and ready to confront her trials once more, highlighting the themes of resilience and renewal.""

Keep up the good work, and continue refining your skills. Your thoughts and interpretations are on the right track!",0.8510088247642102,0.8640792450786456
23,77,"The essay lacks clarity and focus, making it difficult to grasp the main idea. While the author attempts to conclude the story by highlighting Saeng's resolve to retake a failed test, the reasoning behind this resolution is not well-developed or supported by specific details from the text. The essay does not adhere closely to the prompt and provides minimal relevant information from the story. Language issues, such as grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures, impede readability and detract from the overall coherence of the essay. The narrative is disjointed and fails to engage the reader, showing a need for better organization and more effective use of transitional elements. To improve, the writer should focus on developing a clear thesis, providing specific examples from the text, and ensuring grammatical accuracy for better readability.",77,"**Teacher Feedback:**

Your essay provides a foundation for understanding why the author concludes the story with Saeng's vow. However, there are several areas that need improvement to meet the criteria for success.

1. **Clarity and Practicality:** Your explanation is somewhat vague and lacks specific details from the text to support your points clearly. Make sure to include concrete examples from the story, such as Saeng’s emotional connection to the hibiscus and her evolving sense of belonging, to strengthen your argument.

2. **Thesis Statement:** Your thesis needs more precision. It should clearly state the main reason why the author ends the story with Saeng's vow. For example, you could say something like, ""The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow because it symbolizes her determination to adapt to her new life while holding onto cherished memories of her past.""

3. **Logical Organization:** Your essay would benefit from a more structured format. Start with an introduction that includes a clear thesis statement, followed by body paragraphs that provide evidence from the text, and conclude with a summary that reinforces your main argument.

4. **Language and Grammar:** Ensure your language is precise and free of grammatical errors. For example, ""now that shes found"" should be ""now that she's found."" Improve sentence structure to enhance readability.

5. **Real-World Relevance:** Tie your arguments to real-world concepts where possible. Explain how Saeng’s experience of blending past memories with new realities mirrors the common immigrant experience of finding balance between two cultures.

6. **Transitional Phrases:** Use transitional phrases to help your essay flow better. For example, ""Furthermore,"" ""In addition,"" and ""Therefore,"" can help connect your ideas logically.

Here is a revised version of your thesis and first sentence to guide improvement:

""The author concludes the story with Saeng’s vow because it symbolizes her growing resolve to embrace her new life while preserving her cultural identity. As she plants the 'winter hibiscus,' a symbol of her past and present, Saeng’s determination to retake the test in the spring reflects her newfound comfort and resilience.""

Remember, consistent practice and attention to these areas will significantly enhance the clarity, organization, and persuasiveness of your writing. Keep working on integrating specific details from the text and refining your arguments. Good effort!","

“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy
potted plant by the corner. 
There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals
splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of
recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 
“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. 
A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with
vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into
the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the
bucket. 
Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,
oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had
not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. 
When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and
cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel. 
And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with
purplish petals and white centers. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced. How strange to
see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick
walls or between tiled roofs. 
And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and
found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.
“Dok Malik,” she said,
savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its
tag, “jasmine.” 
One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed
her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could
almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she
combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng
would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. 
Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm
around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed
comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? 
A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a
channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. 
And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. 
It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the
last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.
As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of
the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to
her. 
Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. “Ghup ma laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully.
“Goodness, it’s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?” Then she noticed
the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. 
Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. “Where
did you get it?” 
“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question. 
“How much?” 
For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. 
“That’s all?” Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the 
Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .” 
“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said. 
“Then what else—?” 
“Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” 
“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously. “But how could you? All the seeds for this
vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed
the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. 
“What happened?” she asked, more gently. 
“I—I failed the test,” Saeng said. 
For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the
eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. 
Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng’s hands. “It’s a beautiful
plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.” 
“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. 
“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the
words at home, lest she burst into tears again. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said. 
“I know,” her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t
as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.
That’s what matters.” 
She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her
other hand. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said. “Let’s plant it, right now.” 
She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The
soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair
trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There
was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. 
“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. 
Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and
start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?” 
“I’d love it,” Saeng said. 
Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.
She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,
the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth
watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not
even Mrs. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.
But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. 
The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.
Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng
now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange
before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her
now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against
the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. 
When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the
geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is by herself, and letting herself know that she is going to try the test she failed again because she is starting to get used to her new home now that shes found something that reminds her of her life before she left.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay! Here are some constructive points to help you enhance your writing further:

1. **Clarity and Structure**: Your paragraph conveys the key idea, but it could benefit from clearer structure and more detail. Try to break down your thoughts into smaller, more digestible sentences. This will help your reader follow your argument more easily.

2. **Grammar and Mechanics**: Pay attention to punctuation and grammar. For instance, ""shes"" should be ""she's."" Also, consider breaking the long sentence into two or three shorter ones to enhance readability.

3. **Specificity**: You mention that Saeng found something that reminds her of her past, but you don't specify what that is. Adding this detail would make your conclusion stronger and more vivid.

4. **Depth of Analysis**: Expand on why the reminder of her past is significant for Saeng. How does it help her feel more at home? What does this suggest about her character or the broader themes of the story?

5. **Engagement**: Your concluding sentence should leave a lasting impression. Consider rephrasing to make it more impactful, perhaps by highlighting Saeng's growth or newfound determination.

Here's a revised version incorporating these points:

""The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's journey toward resilience and adaptation. Alone and introspective, Saeng resolves to retake the test she previously failed, symbolizing her growing comfort in her new environment. This shift occurs as she discovers an element that connects her to her past life, a reminder that bridges her old and new worlds. This discovery not only fosters a sense of belonging but also reignites her determination to succeed, highlighting her inner strength and the theme of perseverance throughout the narrative.""

Keep up the great effort, and continue to refine your writing skills!",0.9048870369712729,0.9119406127455827
24,81,"The essay demonstrates a commendable effort in capturing the essence of Narciso Rodriguez's reflections on his home and family. The author successfully conveys the heartwarming and appreciative tone that Rodriguez created, specifically highlighting the sense of comfort and unity within his family environment. However, the essay could benefit from a clearer and more relevant thesis statement to guide the reader. The arguments should be more practical and supported with direct, real-world examples from the memoir to strengthen the case. The conclusion does a reasonable job of reinforcing the thesis but could emphasize practical implications more effectively. The organization of the essay is generally clear, with coherent transitions and well-defined topic sentences, although there are moments where the structure could be tighter. Language use is decent, but several grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and some awkward phrasing detract from the overall clarity and precision. Improving these elements would enhance the essay's readability and effectiveness. Overall, the essay is interesting and generally maintains a smooth narrative flow, but it could be more engaging with better transitional elements and stronger linkage between points.",81,"Thank you for your effort in analyzing the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir. Here are some detailed comments and suggestions to help you improve your essay:

### Strengths:
1. **Identification of Mood**: You correctly identified that the mood created by the author includes heartwarming and appreciation. This is a great start as it aligns with the memoir's sentiments.
2. **Use of Quotes**: You have included direct quotes from the memoir, which is an excellent way to support your points. This shows an understanding of the text and an ability to reference specific passages.

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis needs to be clearer and more specific. Currently, it combines two ideas (""heartwarming and appreciation"") without fully explaining how these moods are developed in the memoir. Try to articulate a clear thesis that outlines the main argument of your essay.

2. **Development of Arguments**: Your essay would benefit from more detailed and structured arguments. For instance, when you mention the author's appreciation for his parents, provide specific examples and elaborate on how these examples contribute to the overall mood of the memoir. Use more quotes and explain their relevance in detail.

3. **Organization and Transitions**: Improve the organization by using clear paragraphs, each focusing on a single point that supports your thesis. Smooth transitions between paragraphs will help the reader follow your train of thought. For example, you could separate the discussion on the heartwarming aspects from the parts that show appreciation, making each section more coherent.

4. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are several grammatical errors and misspellings in your essay, such as ""comftable"" (comfortable), ""enviroment"" (environment), and ""familly"" (family). Proofreading your work and using tools like spell check can help eliminate these errors.

5. **Clarity and Sentence Structure**: Some sentences are confusing or awkwardly structured. For instance, ""Not only Just being together but being together"" is redundant. Aim for clear and concise sentences. Also, ensure each sentence contributes to your argument.

### Practical Suggestions:
- **Revise Your Thesis**: Try something like, ""In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood of warmth and appreciation by illustrating the close-knit nature of his family and their sacrifices for a better life.""
- **Expand on Key Points**: When discussing how the home was heartwarming, mention specific family traditions or community interactions that exemplify this mood. Similarly, for appreciation, discuss specific sacrifices his parents made and how they impacted the author's life.
- **Paragraph Structure**: Start with a topic sentence for each paragraph that clearly states the main point. Follow with evidence from the text and an explanation of how this evidence supports your point.
- **Proofreading**: After writing, take the time to read your essay aloud or ask someone else to review it. This can help catch errors and improve the overall readability of your essay.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay does not fully meet the criteria outlined in the guidelines. The content lacks a clear, relevant thesis and offers minimal development of arguments with real-world examples. The conclusion, while attempting to reinforce the initial sentiment, falls short in effectiveness. Organizationally, the essay is weak, with unclear transitions and poorly defined topic sentences, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. The language and style are hampered by frequent grammatical errors, incorrect punctuation, and a limited, often repetitive vocabulary. Additionally, the essay significantly lacks coherence and logical structure, resulting in a disjointed narrative. To improve, focus on creating a clear thesis, supporting arguments with detailed real-world examples, and ensuring logical flow with well-defined topic sentences and smooth transitions.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay exhibits a basic understanding of the mood in the memoir, identifying it as ""slightly difficult, somewhat depressing, yet grateful."" However, the analysis lacks depth and clarity, with minimal evidence from the memoir to support these points. The thesis statement is not clearly articulated, and the arguments are not well-developed or supported by specific examples. The structure is somewhat disjointed, with an abrupt transition from the mood discussion to the summary of Narciso Rodriguez's story. The essay's language and style contain several grammatical errors and misspellings, such as ""diffucult,"" ""depresing,"" and ""gratefull."" Sentence structures are often awkward and lack variety. Additionally, the narrative flow is hindered by the absence of coherent transitions and well-defined topic sentences, making the essay difficult to follow. Overall, the essay needs significant improvement in clarity, organization, and the use of supporting evidence to effectively analyze the mood of the memoir.

DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 5 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Narciso Rodriguez 
from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives 
My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a 
furnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old 
Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon 
call home. 
In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the 
Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our 
traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared 
cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking 
that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which 
I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of 
childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed 
both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. 
Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that “family” had nothing to do with 
being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, 
Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation 
prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these 
cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of 
honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their 
own kind, were clearly in need. 
Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and 
Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio 
and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not 
know my “real” grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were 
allowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and 
Rosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family 
members came and went — and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they 
were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the 
many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. 
My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the 
language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a 
better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country 
they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters 
while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were 
strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind 
of jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had 
studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, 
taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their 
children to better times drove them to endure these hard times. 
I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I’ve often told them that what 
they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I’ve often told them of 
my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I’ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in 
reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at 
such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two 
lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these 
teachings have been the basis of my life. 
It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to 
this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this 
humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not 
just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of “family.” 
And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I 
learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into 
a home.

TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay on the theme of home and family. You have chosen a heartfelt topic that resonates with many people, and you conveyed some meaningful insights. Here are some suggestions to help you improve your essay:

1. **Clarity and Structure**:
   - Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Start with an introduction that outlines what you will discuss. Follow with body paragraphs that each focus on a specific point, and conclude with a summary that ties everything together.
   - For example, you can start with a sentence introducing the author and the main theme of their work, then move on to discussing specific aspects like the mood, the environment, and the sense of family.

2. **Grammar and Spelling**:
   - Pay attention to spelling and grammar. There are a few errors that need correction, such as ""comftable"" (comfortable), ""enviroment"" (environment), ""familly"" (family), ""wiched"" (which), ""deseverd"" (deserved).
   - Also, ensure that punctuation is used correctly. For instance, use commas and periods to separate sentences clearly and make your writing easier to read.

3. **Quotations and Citations**:
   - When you use quotations, integrate them smoothly into your sentences and make sure they are accurate. For example: Growing up in this environment instilled in him a great sense that ""family"" has nothing to do with being a blood relative.
   - Cite the source properly if there is a specific reference you are drawing from.

4. **Expression and Vocabulary**:
   - Aim to use a varied vocabulary to make your writing more engaging. Instead of repeating words like ""appreciation"" and ""together,"" try using synonyms or rephrasing your sentences.
   - For example, instead of ""Narciso Rodriguez show his appreciation,"" you might say, ""Narciso Rodriguez demonstrates his gratitude.""

5. **Content and Analysis**:
   - Your essay touches upon important points but needs deeper analysis. Explain why the author's appreciation for his home and family is significant. How does it impact him or his life?
   - Discuss the themes and emotions more thoroughly. For example, you mentioned bravery—expand on this by exploring what sacrifices were made and why they were important.

Here’s a revised version of your opening to illustrate these suggestions:

---

""Home and family are fundamental aspects that all of us cherish.

Overall, the essay showcases a high degree of originality, creative expression, and effective communication.",88,"The essay you have written demonstrates a clear stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, presenting well-thought-out arguments and examples to support your position. Your use of historical context, such as referencing older books and their language, adds depth and relevance to your argument. This approach is not only informative but also encourages readers to think critically about the historical and cultural significance of the materials we choose to censor.

**Strengths:**

1. **Originality and Creative Expression:**
   - Your essay effectively explores the nuanced reasons why certain materials should not be censored, even if they contain offensive content. This demonstrates a unique and thoughtful perspective that challenges the reader to consider the broader implications of censorship.

2. **Use of Examples:**
   - The examples you provided, like the book ""The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1"" and the discussion on movie and music ratings, are vivid and relevant. They help to illustrate your points clearly and make your arguments more compelling.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Organization and Flow:**

For instance, linking the discussion about books more seamlessly with your points on movies and music would enhance the overall coherence. Consider using transitional phrases to guide the reader through your arguments.

2. **Word Choice and Clarity:**
   - There are several instances where word choice could be refined for greater impact. For example, phrases such as ""parent groups and others are trying to get that book pulled off of shelves in hopes of erasing what was done in the past"" could be rephrased to be more concise and powerful.
   - Additionally, ensure that terms like ""legally"" and ""categories"" are spelled correctly to maintain professionalism and readability.

3. **Sentence Fluency:**
   - Varying your sentence structures more can make your essay more engaging. Try mixing shorter, impactful sentences with longer, more descriptive ones to keep the reader's interest.

4. **Conventions:**
   - Pay close attention to minor grammatical and spelling errors. For instance, ""neccessarily"" should be ""necessarily,"" and ""exsisted"" should be ""existed."" Proofreading your essay carefully will help to eliminate such errors and enhance the overall quality of your writing.

**Final Thoughts:**

Your essay is a strong and creative exploration of the topic of censorship. By focusing on the importance of historical context and the role of parents in media consumption, you bring unique and thoughtful perspectives to the discussion.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: customer's as well. For instance think about a movie store. If the only movies sold were @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 there would be a lot less people wanting to go to that store, because then it just turns into a child's store. Even censoring the movies would not be effective because your taking away the art of having an unfiltered movie.                   So my simple solution is obvious. Movies have ratings based on maturity content, so why shouldn't books. Books that deal with more controversal

Books that deal with more controversal content shouldn't be placed in the shelves next to young readers' books, and they should have a label indicating that the specific book @MONTH1 contain material not suitable for a person under a specific age. People trying to censor entertainment and look into the best interest of their loved ones is perfectly fine, but you cant blindfold them forever. Were all on the same planet and we all reach

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: If there is an offensive book or a bad @CAPS2 and someone doesn't like it and feels the need to remove it, that is @CAPS3 but then they aren't thinking of what other people might like. I have always heard the saying, 'If everybody liked the same thing, it would be a boring world.' I find this to be completely true.      If everybody liked the same thing, then let anybody that enters the library remove an offensive item. However, if this happens, authors won't want to keep writing books and

off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then

left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, Author

---------------------------

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Most modern day book, movies, music, etc. do a fairly good job of placing warning in the form of '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticks on their covers. But books from before this practice began to happen @MONTH1 be found more offensive then books today. Why? Well, that's because many books of the past use words that today are found offensive. But those books, movies, and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem. There are examples of how each catagory is in today's society.     Take the book 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', written by @PERSON1, for example. In that story, there are words that are used to describe people of that time.. Back when @PERSON1 wrote the book, it was perfectly fine to use those words on those people, but in today's modern world, that is a book that has been on the list for being banned. It is offensive to use that word on people today, so parent groups and others are trying to get that book pulled off of shelves in hopes of erasing what was done in the past. I don't believe that a book should be banned for it's content, but rather how well it teaches its reader through its words. If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and the culture of that time, then it shouldn't be banned at all. It should be read.     Movies have a rating system for a reason. There are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience. People must be of a certain age to rent, buy, or view these kind of movies 'leagally'. Not too many people listen to that system, even though it has exsisted for years. A horror film is not suitable for a @CAPS15 of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on @CAPS4. Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a @CAPS15 nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong. That is the fault of the parents. They were the ones who let their @CAPS15 watch that movie in the first place. So the movie shouldn't be held responsible for the @CAPS15. If the movie was intended for a more mature audience, that's the way it should stay.     And that brings us to music. There is a lot of music in today's age that can be considered very offensive. There are only a few 'pure' genres, free of the cursing that is used in many of the others today. But children, teen, and adults all find their favorite kind, and you can't change their minds then. The governement has issued that all music containing harsh words, horrid images to the mind, gruesome scenes, and other elements that are offensive to people, must carry a sticker on it. The black and white '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticker. When parents see this sticker on the @CAPS7, @NUM1 download, or whatever their @CAPS15 is using, then they know that it is more than likely not right for their @CAPS15 to listen to. Doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it means that there is a slight chance that their minds will not be tainted by 'garbage'.     So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't neccessarily mean that it is the same to another person. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society. People will still argue that books such as 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON2', '@CAPS10 in the @CAPS11', and many, many more books like them should be banned. They will always fight that movies such as 'A @CAPS12 on @CAPS13 @CAPS14,' '@DATE1 the @NUM2', or '@CAPS15's @CAPS16' should be removed from store shelves because it gave them nightmares as a @CAPS19 or it gives their @CAPS15 nightmares because they saw it. And they will always try to fight and say that artist like @CAPS17' @CAPS18, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS19 @CAPS20 are not suited for their @CAPS15. Well, this pattern has been going on for years. Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for a adult audience, not for a @CAPS15 of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue about what should be on shelves and what should not, remember that it might be that parent's fault for letting their @CAPS15 view it in the first place.

","### Feedback:

#### Content and Argumentation:
1. **Thesis Statement**: Your essay presents a clear stance on the issue of censoring books, movies, and music. However, the thesis could be more explicitly stated at the beginning to guide the reader through your argument.

2. **Supporting Evidence**: You provide examples from books and movies, but these examples are not fully developed. It would be beneficial to elaborate on specific instances and how they illustrate your point. For example, instead of using placeholders like '@CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', provide real titles and authors to strengthen your argument.

3. **Logical Flow**: Your points on books, movies, and music are somewhat disjointed. Consider using clearer topic sentences and transitions to improve the coherence of your essay.

#### Structure and Organization:
1. **Paragraph Structure**: Each paragraph should start with a clear topic sentence that outlines the main idea. Ensure that all sentences within the paragraph support the topic sentence and contribute to the overall argument.

2. **Conclusion**: The conclusion reiterates your main points well, but it could be more concise. Focus on summarizing your key arguments and reinforcing your thesis.

#### Language and Grammar:
1. **Word Choice**: Be mindful of the words you choose. For example, ""leagally"" should be ""legally,"" and ""exsisted"" should be ""existed."" Proofreading your work can help catch these errors.

2. **Clarity**: Some sentences are confusing due to poor word choice or structure. For instance, ""But books from before this practice began to happen @MONTH1 be found more offensive then books today"" is unclear. Ensure each sentence clearly conveys your intended meaning.

3. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are multiple grammatical errors, such as ""it's"" instead of ""its,"" ""catagory"" instead of ""category,"" and ""neccessarily"" instead of ""necessarily."" These mistakes can distract from your argument and should be corrected.

#### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Develop Examples**: Replace placeholders with real examples and elaborate on them to strengthen your argument.
2. **Proofread**: Carefully proofread your essay to correct grammatical and spelling errors.
3. **Transitional Phrases**: Use transitional phrases to improve the flow of your argument between paragraphs.
4. **Conciseness**: Be more concise, especially in your conclusion, to ensure your main points are clear and impactful.

Overall, your essay addresses an important issue and presents a clear stance. With more detailed examples, improved coherence, and careful proofreading, your writing will be much stronger. Keep up the good work and continue to refine your skills!",0.9378202187638972,0.9288004172667581
26,91,"The essay effectively addresses the setting's impact on the cyclist, using specific examples to illustrate how various features, such as the hills, the road signs, and the abandoned grape juice factory, contribute to his challenges and eventual relief. However, the response could benefit from deeper analysis and more detailed exploration of these elements to fully capture their significance. The language is clear, and there is a basic structure in place, but the essay would be more engaging with varied vocabulary and sentence structures. The transitions between ideas are present but could be smoother to enhance the overall flow. Additionally, while the essay stays on topic, there are moments where it could delve deeper into the cyclist's emotional and physical journey to provide a richer narrative. Overall, the response is cohesive and understandable, but it could be more compelling with more vivid language and a more thorough examination of the setting’s effects on the cyclist.",91,"Your essay on ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" does a commendable job of identifying several key features of the setting and their impact on the cyclist. I appreciate your effort to pinpoint specific elements, such as the hills, the road sign, and the grape juice advertisement, and discuss how they contribute to the character’s experience. These are excellent observations and show that you are engaging thoughtfully with the text.

**Strengths:**

1. **Identification of Setting Elements:** You have successfully identified several features of the setting that affect the cyclist, such as the hills, the road sign, and the grape juice advertisement. This shows good attention to detail and an understanding of how setting influences narrative.
   
2. **Use of Quotes:** Incorporating direct quotes from the text adds strength to your argument. It demonstrates that you are closely reading and using the source material to support your points.

3. **Creative Interpretation:** Your interpretation of the cyclist’s feelings, especially regarding the ironic grape juice advertisement, is both original and insightful. This kind of creative thinking is exactly what I aim to foster in this class.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Depth and Development:** While you have identified several key features, your analysis could benefit from deeper exploration. For example, you mention the hills but don't fully delve into how they physically and mentally challenge the cyclist. Try to expand on each point to give a more comprehensive picture.

2. **Narrative Flow:** Your essay could improve in terms of narrative flow. Ensure that your ideas transition smoothly from one to the next. Using transitional phrases can help guide your reader through your arguments more coherently.

3. **Language Variety:** Your vocabulary is functional, but there is room to incorporate more varied and imaginative language. This can help make your essay more engaging and reflective of your unique voice.

4. **Conclusion:** Your conclusion could be a bit stronger. Instead of just summarizing the negative effects, you might want to reflect on what these hardships say about the cyclist’s character or the broader theme of the essay. This will add depth to your analysis and leave your reader with something to ponder.

**Suggestions for Enhancement:**

- **Expand on Examples:** Take each feature you mention and expand on it. Discuss not just how it affects the cyclist immediately, but what it signifies in the context of the essay. For instance, what do the hills symbolize in his journey?
  
- **Improve Transitions:** Use phrases like ""Furthermore,"" ""In addition to,"" or ""As a result,"" to link your ideas more seamlessly.

- **Enhance Vocabulary:** Consider using more descriptive adjectives and varied sentence structures to keep your reader engaged. For example, instead of “exasperated,” you might say “the relentless hills exacerbated his exhaustion.”

Overall, you are on the right track with identifying and discussing the setting’s impact on the cyclist. With a bit more depth and creative flair, your analysis could shine even brighter. Keep pushing the boundaries of your expression and","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to discuss the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the story. The ideas are underdeveloped and the content is minimal, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the intended message. There is a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points being made, which weakens the overall argument. The response also tends to wander off-topic and does not adhere closely to the prompt. The language used is simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors, such as ""shes"" instead of ""she's"" and ""sentance"" instead of ""sentence."" These errors distract from the readability of the essay and hinder its effectiveness. Additionally, the essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes the narrative difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing detailed support from the story, maintaining clarity in addressing the prompt, enhancing vocabulary, and ensuring a smooth flow of ideas with proper transitions.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: According to @PERSON1, economic @CAPS1, every hour you spend on the computer, you raise your electricity bill by @MONEY2. The average @CAPS2 spends @NUM1 hours on the computer everyday. I believe that spending too much time on the computer could be a bad thing. You have economic loss from the electric bill, health loss because you won't be able to exercise as much, and community less because you won't spen as much with your community. Financial loss is something that many people are concerned

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and focused argument against excessive computer use, supported by recognizable main ideas: financial loss, health issues, and community disintegration. The originality of the thesis could be improved by providing a more unique or thought-provoking perspective on the topic. The essay is satisfactorily organized, with a basic introduction, body, and conclusion, though the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow of ideas. The word choice effectively conveys the intended message, but there is room for more varied and imaginative language to make the essay more engaging. The sentences generally flow well, though some constructions could be more fluid and varied to maintain the reader’s interest. The essay demonstrates control of standard writing conventions, but there are noticeable errors in spelling and grammar that slightly impede readability. Overall, the essay is clear and persuasive but could benefit from more creative expression and polished language use to fully align with the teacher's emphasis on originality and creative expression.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: loss there is also a health issue. Many people are talking about how americans are becoming obise. Part @MONEY1 this is due to spending too much time on the computer.

DOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit 
by Joe Kurmaskie 
FORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece 
of advice for the solo cyclist would be, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers 
who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” It’s not that a group of 
old guys doesn’t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid 
place. Things change. 
At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer 
evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn’t have done was 
let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice 
and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to 
Yosemite National Park. 
They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I 
would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with 
strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town.” 
This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time—say, before the last world war—but 
on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water 
supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool 
pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. 
Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, 
and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had 
been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of 
California in June. 
I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my 
strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the 
neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water 
wouldn’t cool down. It didn’t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. 
The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make 
that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so—a test of my inner spirit. 
Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was 
replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign 
jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. 
The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so 
cruel. 
I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it 
really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased 
past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. 
The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my 
shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June 
simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, 
caused me to laugh. 
It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. 
There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride 
down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d 
be fine. 
Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make 
sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst 
of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. 
In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building—abandoned years 
earlier, by the looks of it—had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A 
sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still 
be seen. 
I hung my head. 
That smoky blues tune “Summertime” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating 
brain. 
I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. 
I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you 
have left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. 
It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some 
expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and 
their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I 
was going to lose consciousness for the last time. 
Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining 
elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear 
were all behind me. 
GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP—IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE 
YOUR BEST BET! 
“And the only bet,” I remember thinking. 
As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an 
overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait—any bait, even 
though I didn’t own a rod or reel. 
An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from 
my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. 
“Where you headed in such a hurry?” 
“Yosemite,” I whispered. 
“Know the best way to get there?” 
I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group 
I’d listened to in Lodi. 
“Yes, sir! I own a very good map.” 
And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: In the essay, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit there are many features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. Many of these features affect him in a negative way. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist. I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait. All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Certainly! Here is some constructive feedback on the student's essay:

---

**Feedback:**

Dear [Student's Name],

Thank you for submitting your essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" You have done a commendable job in identifying and discussing how different features of the setting affect the cyclist. Here are some points to help you further improve your writing:

1. **Introduction and Conclusion:**
   - **Introduction:** Your essay could benefit from a more robust introduction that provides context for the reader and states the thesis clearly. For example, you could introduce the essay's main themes and how the setting influences the cyclist's journey.
   - **Conclusion:** While you do summarize the main points, try to restate the thesis in a way that encapsulates the overall impact of the setting on the cyclist, offering a final reflection or insight.

2. **Clarity and Specificity:**
   - **Details:** When you mention certain features, such as the ""hills"" and the ""sun,"" try to be more specific about how they affect the cyclist. For example, ""The steep hills and the relentless sun significantly drained the cyclist's energy and morale.""
   - **Quotes:** Integrate quotes more smoothly into your sentences. For example, instead of ""The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2,"" you could say, “The cyclist struggled to maintain speed, noting the irony in the ‘Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit’ sign as he could barely pedal at @NUM2 mph.”

3. **Grammar and Word Choice:**
   - **Exasperated vs. Exacerbated:** Use ""exacerbated"" instead of ""exasperated"" in the context of worsening the cyclist's condition.
   - **Word Choice:** Avoid repetitive phrases like ""probably felt"" and ""probably made him feel."" They can be replaced with more assertive language to convey the impact more confidently.

4. **Flow and Coherence:**
   - **Transitions:** Ensure that your essay flows smoothly from one point to the next. For instance, you can use transitional phrases like ""Furthermore,"" ""In addition,"" and ""Moreover"" to connect your ideas better.

5. **Analysis and Insight:**
   - **Deeper Analysis:** Offer deeper analysis on how the setting elements relate to the overall theme or message of the essay. For example, discuss how the setting’s challenges might symbolize broader life challenges and the cyclist’s resilience.

Here's a revised example of a section from your essay:

**Original:** ""Another feature was the road sign that said 'Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit' 'The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.' The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it.""

**Revised:** ""Another challenging feature of the setting was the road sign that read 'Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit",0.9227325558070585,0.8919464921182483
27,92,"The essay lacks clarity, structure, and strong content, making it difficult to engage with and understand. The thesis statement is vague and lacks originality, failing to present a unique or thought-provoking idea about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The essay does not develop supporting arguments creatively, and the conclusion is ineffective and fails to provide a fresh perspective. The organization is disjointed, with a lack of clear flow and smooth transitions between ideas, leading to a confusing and fragmented narrative. The language and style are monotonous, with a limited vocabulary and repetitive sentence structures that do not captivate the reader. Additionally, the essay contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that further detract from its readability. Overall, the essay does not meet the standards for originality, creative expression, or imaginative language use as outlined in the guidelines.",92,"Your response offers a solid foundation by identifying some of the obstacles the cyclist faces, like rough terrain and snakes. You've recognized the importance of a cyclist being aware of their environment and the potential dangers that can arise from trusting unreliable sources. This is a great starting point, and it shows your ability to engage with the text and think critically about the challenges presented.

To further improve and enhance your creative expression, consider adding more specific examples from the source text to support your points. For instance, when you mention the ""rocks in the way,"" you could describe the moment when the cyclist encounters a large snake or the abandoned town, which adds vividness to your narrative and grounds your arguments in the source material. 

Moreover, organizing your ideas into clear and distinct paragraphs will help in making your essay more coherent and easier to follow. For example, you could have one paragraph focusing on the physical challenges, like the rough terrain and weather conditions, and another on the psychological aspects, such as the cyclist's reliance on his own judgment over the advice of others.

Your conclusion can also benefit from a stronger closing remark that ties back to the cyclist's journey and the lessons learned from their experience. Perhaps reflect on how these difficulties ultimately contribute to the cyclist's growth and resilience.

Lastly, pay attention to minor grammatical and spelling errors, such as ""that why"" instead of ""that's why."" This will enhance the readability and professionalism of your writing.

Overall, your essay has a strong grasp of the central themes, and with some additional details and structural improvements, it has the potential to be even more impactful and engaging. Keep pushing those creative boundaries!","

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Computers are very important, I dont know anyone who does not need one. But some people say that it distracts you from exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friend. Do I agree? No I disagree with this situation because computers are a modern day tech that people use. They say it distracts you from interacting with family and friends but a computer is the number one way to talk to long distance friends and family, @CAPS1 without a computer how will those people who work

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a clear stance on the importance of computers in modern life, demonstrating a strong grasp of the topic. Your arguments are focused and supported with relevant examples, such as the use of social media platforms like MySpace and Facebook for maintaining long-distance relationships, and the necessity of computers for business and research purposes. The introduction succinctly sets the stage for your argument, and the conclusion effectively reinforces your main points while offering practical advice on balancing computer use with other activities.

However, the structure of the essay could be improved for better readability. Organizing your points into distinct paragraphs with smooth transitions would enhance the flow of ideas. For example, separating the discussion on social media, business use, and research into individual paragraphs would make your essay more coherent. Additionally, while your vocabulary is appropriate and varied, further refinement in word choice could add more precision and interest to your writing.

Your sentence structures are varied and mostly effective, contributing to a smooth reading experience. Still, addressing some repetitive phrases and minor grammatical errors would elevate the overall quality. For instance, consistent capitalization, punctuation, and spelling accuracy are essential for clear communication, even though creative deviations are acceptable. 

Overall, your essay is engaging and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. With some improvements in organization and attention to detail in language use, your writing will be even more impactful and enjoyable to read.

who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” It’s not that a group of 
old guys doesn’t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid 
place. Things change. 
At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer 
evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn’t have done was 
let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice 
and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to 
Yosemite National Park. 
They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I 
would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with 
strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town.” 
This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time—say, before the last world war—but 
on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water 
supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool 
pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. 
Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, 
and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had 
been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of 
California in June. 
I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my 
strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the 
neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water 
wouldn’t cool down. It didn’t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. 
The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make 
that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so—a test of my inner spirit. 
Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was 
replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign 
jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. 
The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so 
cruel. 
I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it 
really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased 
past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. 
The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my 
shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June 
simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, 
caused me to laugh. 
It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. 
There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride 
down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d 
be fine. 
Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make 
sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst 
of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. 
In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building—abandoned years 
earlier, by the looks of it—had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A 
sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still 
be seen. 
I hung my head. 
That smoky blues tune “Summertime” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating 
brain. 
I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. 
I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you 
have left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. 
It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some 
expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and 
their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I 
was going to lose consciousness for the last time. 
Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining 
elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear 
were all behind me. 
GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP—IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE 
YOUR BEST BET! 
“And the only bet,” I remember thinking. 
As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an 
overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait—any bait, even 
though I didn’t own a rod or reel. 
An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from 
my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. 
“Where you headed in such a hurry?” 
“Yosemite,” I whispered. 
“Know the best way to get there?” 
I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group 
I’d listened to in Lodi. 
“Yes, sir! I own a very good map.” 
And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The features affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the road, the rocks everything close. The cyclist needs to know everything about where he's going, because if not then he can run into some problems along the way, For example like snakes, rough terrain, rocks in the way. That why its important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves. That why when you see cyclist you see them around, a road where theres cars around, just in case they get into trouble.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","FEEDBACK:

Thank you for your essay. I can see that you have put thought into how a cyclist needs to be aware of their surroundings. However, there are several areas you could improve:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: Your essay could benefit from clearer organization. Try to structure your ideas in a more logical order. For instance, first discuss the various features that affect cyclists, then explain the importance of being aware of these features. 

2. **Detail and Examples**: While you mention several factors that can affect a cyclist, such as roads, rocks, and snakes, it would be helpful to expand on these points with more detailed examples or explanations. For instance, explain how rough terrain specifically affects cycling.

3. **Grammar and Punctuation**: There are several grammatical errors and incomplete sentences that need attention. For example, ""For example the road, the rocks everything close."" could be revised to ""For example, the road, the rocks, and everything nearby can affect the cyclist."" Also, ""That why its important"" should be ""That's why it's important.""

4. **Pronoun Consistency**: Be consistent with pronoun usage. You shift between ""he"" and ""they"". Pick one and stick to it throughout the essay to maintain clarity.

5. **Misconceptions**: The line ""That why its important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves"" might be misleading. Cyclists often need to heed advice from experienced cyclists, maps, or even safety instructions. Consider revising this to emphasize the importance of being self-reliant while also staying informed.

6. **Safety and Context**: When you mention that cyclists are often seen on roads with cars, it’s important to clarify the context. Stress the importance of safety and being visible to others on the road, and perhaps mention the value of wearing protective gear like helmets.

Here is a revised version of your essay with these suggestions incorporated:

---

The features of the environment affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the road conditions, nearby rocks, and other environmental factors can significantly impact the ride. A cyclist needs to be fully aware of their surroundings because if they are not, they can encounter problems along the way, such as encountering snakes, navigating rough terrain, or avoiding rocks in their path. 

That's why it's important for a cyclist to be well-prepared and informed about their route. While self-reliance is crucial, cyclists should also take advice from reliable sources and use appropriate tools like maps and safety guidelines. 

When you often see cyclists on roads shared with cars, it is important to remember that this choice is made for visibility and safety. Cyclists need to ensure they are visible to drivers and are following traffic rules to minimize risks. Wearing protective gear, such as helmets and reflective clothing, further enhances their safety on busy roads.

Keep up the good work, and keep refining your writing skills!",0.8947288132709809,0.8756565347406366
28,93,"The essay on how settings affect cyclists falls significantly short of the expectations set forth by the teacher's guidelines. The content is simplistic and lacks originality and depth, failing to provide unique or creative insights into the topic. The thesis statement is not clearly defined, and the supporting arguments are underdeveloped and repetitive. The overall organization is weak, with an abrupt and unengaging introduction, poorly structured body paragraphs, and a conclusion that does not offer a fresh perspective. The essay lacks creativity in its flow of ideas, making it difficult to follow. Additionally, the language and style are monotonous and lack variation, with numerous grammatical errors that detract from readability. There is little to no imaginative vocabulary or sentence structure, and the writing does not demonstrate control of standard writing conventions. Overall, the essay needs significant improvement in clarity, structure, content, and language to meet the desired criteria of originality and creative expression.",93,"Your essay touches on an important aspect of the story: how the setting impacts the cyclist’s experience. You’ve identified several key points about the relationship between the setting and the cyclist’s physical and mental state. This is a great start! Let’s work on developing these ideas further to make your essay even more compelling.

Firstly, your observation that a pleasant setting can distract the cyclist from pain is insightful. Can you provide specific examples from the text to support this point? For instance, when the cyclist is enjoying the early summer evening at the reservoir campground, how does this influence his mood and energy?

Similarly, your point about an unpleasant setting intensifying the rider’s discomfort is well-taken. Again, referring to specific instances in the story—like the encounter with the ghost town or the dehydrating desert—would strengthen your argument. How do these settings affect the cyclist’s morale and physical condition?

Your mention of hilly terrain and its effect on the cyclist’s pain and dehydration is accurate and relevant. Can you delve deeper into this and perhaps describe the struggle the cyclist faces as he tackles these hills? The more detailed you are, the more vivid and engaging your essay will become.

Additionally, consider varying your sentence structure and word choice to make your writing more fluid and engaging. Instead of saying, “the setting really does affect the cyclist,” you could try something like, “It is evident that the cyclist’s journey and overall experience are profoundly shaped by the setting.”

Remember, originality and creative expression are key. Think about how you can present these observations in a way that showcases your unique perspective. How does the setting not only affect the cyclist but also relate to the larger themes of the story, such as resilience and the unpredictability of life?

Overall, you’ve laid a solid foundation. With more specific examples from the text and a bit more creative language, your essay can truly shine. Keep pushing the boundaries of your expression, and don’t be afraid to take risks in your writing. Great job so far—keep it up!","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: outside they don't talk to there friends or even see ther friends its mostly not haven a life. And people dont feel like going to school because their over and there tired and ther just want to use the computer all day with not stopping. And so i think that people are just to addicted to compulers they dont use it for the fright reasons. Had then people get sick they could get hoadaks or they feel like puking. And they dont get to see that of things like go to the @CAPS1, @CAPS2 football,

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates an attempt to discuss the impact of computer usage on individuals, but it lacks clarity and effective organization. The main ideas are present but not fully developed or supported with specific details, making the overall argument somewhat simplistic and broad. The essay's structure is disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a need for a clearer flow of ideas. The language used is repetitive and often inappropriate, with many words misused or misspelled, which detracts significantly from the intended message. Sentence structures are awkward and lack fluidity, causing the reader to frequently pause and reread for comprehension. Additionally, the essay contains numerous grammatical errors, incorrect punctuation, and inconsistent capitalization, which further impede readability. However, there are moments of creative expression, and the writer's point of view is clearly stated, though it requires more refinement and stronger support to be more persuasive and engaging. Improving these areas with a focus on originality and imaginative language use, while maintaining grammatical accuracy, will enhance the overall quality of the essay.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to discuss the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the story. The ideas are underdeveloped and the content is minimal, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the intended message. There is a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points being made, which weakens the overall argument. The response also tends to wander off-topic and does not adhere closely to the prompt. The language used is simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors, such as ""shes"" instead of ""she's"" and ""sentance"" instead of ""sentence."" These errors distract from the readability of the essay and hinder its effectiveness. Additionally, the essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes the narrative difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing detailed support from the story, maintaining clarity in addressing the prompt, enhancing vocabulary, and ensuring a smooth flow of ideas with proper transitions.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: loss there is also a health issue. Many people are talking about how americans are becoming obise. Part @MONEY1 this is due to spending too much time on the computer. Proffesor @CAPS3 @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 says that, ""the obisety in @LOCATION1 is a problem, if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, that problem would be solved."" @CAPS4, @NUM5 out @MONEY1 @NUM6 people are obese. If everyone spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, it would become @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM6.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and focused argument against excessive computer use, supported by recognizable main ideas: financial loss, health issues, and community disintegration. The originality of the thesis could be improved by providing a more unique or thought-provoking perspective on the topic. The essay is satisfactorily organized, with a basic introduction, body, and conclusion, though the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow of ideas. The word choice effectively conveys the intended message, but there is room for more varied and imaginative language to make the essay more engaging. The sentences generally flow well, though some constructions could be more fluid and varied to maintain the reader’s interest. The essay demonstrates control of standard writing conventions, but there are noticeable errors in spelling and grammar that slightly impede readability. Overall, the essay is clear and persuasive but could benefit from more creative expression and polished language use to fully align with the teacher's emphasis on originality and creative expression.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isnt very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Dear Student,

Thank you for your effort in writing this essay. Here are some points of feedback to help you improve your writing:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**:
   - The main idea of your essay is clear, but it would benefit from a more structured approach. Consider breaking your ideas into distinct paragraphs, each focusing on a specific aspect of how settings affect cyclists.
   - Ensure that each sentence logically flows from one to the next. This will make your argument more coherent and easier to follow.

2. **Grammar and Punctuation**:
   - Pay attention to capitalization and punctuation. For example, ""also"" should be capitalized at the beginning of a sentence, and ""isn't very nice"" should be separated with a comma.
   - Eliminate any typographical errors like the use of ""&"" instead of ""and"" and ""@MONTH1"" which seems to be a placeholder error.

3. **Word Choice and Sentence Structure**:
   - Varied sentence structure can make your writing more engaging. Try to avoid repetitive phrasing, such as ""the rider... the rider..."".
   - Avoid using words like ""drive"" when referring to cycling; ""ride"" would be more appropriate.

4. **Depth of Analysis**:
   - Provide more detailed examples or explanations to support your points. For instance, explain how a beautiful setting can enhance the cycling experience or provide more details on how a hilly terrain can affect a cyclist's performance.

Here’s a revised version of your paragraph to illustrate these points:

""The settings affect cyclists in a variety of ways. If the setting is pleasant, the rider can focus on the scenery rather than the discomfort they might be experiencing. Conversely, if the surroundings are less appealing, the rider is likely to concentrate more on their pain than their environment. Additionally, a hilly terrain presents a physical challenge, causing the cyclist to exert more effort, which can lead to increased pain and quicker dehydration. Clearly, the setting plays a significant role in a cyclist's overall experience.""

Keep working on refining your writing, and don't hesitate to seek feedback and revise your work. Great job, and keep up the good effort!

Best regards,

There is no innovative or creative angle that captures the reader's interest. The organization of the essay is weak, with a brief and unengaging introduction, body paragraphs that lack depth and smooth transitions, and an abrupt conclusion that does not provide a fresh perspective. The language and style are very basic, with a limited range of vocabulary and sentence structures that do not demonstrate creativity or variety. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors and awkward constructions that impede readability. Overall, the essay does not meet the criteria for originality, creative expression, or imaginative language use. To improve, the writer should focus on developing a unique and compelling thesis, providing richer and more creative supporting arguments, and enhancing the organization and flow of ideas. Using more varied and imaginative language and ensuring grammatical accuracy would also significantly enhance the essay's quality.",95,"**Teacher Feedback:**

Your interpretation of Saeng's journey and her determination to adjust to her new home is a wonderful start, and it's great to see you engaging with the themes of perseverance and adaptation. Your essay captures the essence of Saeng's struggle and her resolve to keep trying, which is a crucial aspect of the story.

To enhance your analysis, consider delving deeper into specific details and examples from the text. For instance, you might elaborate on how the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng's connection to her past and her hope for the future. Reflecting on moments like her interaction with the plant and her memories of home can add depth to your response.

Additionally, try to expand on your explanation of why Saeng waits until spring to retake her driving test. You could explore the symbolic significance of spring as a season of renewal and new beginnings, which parallels Saeng's journey of adaptation and growth.

Your writing is clear, but to make it even more compelling, consider using more varied vocabulary and sentence structures. This will not only enhance the readability of your essay but also help convey your ideas with more originality and creativity.

Keep nurturing your analytical skills and don't hesitate to take risks in exploring new perspectives. Your unique voice is a valuable asset, and with a bit more depth and creativity, your essays will truly shine.

Well done, and I look forward to seeing how you continue to develop your ideas!","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to discuss the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the story. The ideas are underdeveloped and the content is minimal, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the intended message. There is a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points being made, which weakens the overall argument. The response also tends to wander off-topic and does not adhere closely to the prompt. The language used is simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors, such as ""shes"" instead of ""she's"" and ""sentance"" instead of ""sentence."" These errors distract from the readability of the essay and hinder its effectiveness. Additionally, the essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes the narrative difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing detailed support from the story, maintaining clarity in addressing the prompt, enhancing vocabulary, and ensuring a smooth flow of ideas with proper transitions.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: he really has a family, that show they care. He appreciates what his parents have done for him. You can tell his very greatful because of the way he expresses himself about his family. ""In reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spint of generosity impressed upon me, and demonstrate of how important family and friends are"". He is a caring young boy.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a genuine effort to explore the theme of family gratitude in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, but it lacks the originality and creative expression that could elevate it. While it includes specific quotations from the memoir, the analysis remains superficial and doesn't delve deeply into the unique aspects of Rodriguez's experiences or emotions. The introduction could be more engaging, and the body paragraphs would benefit from smoother transitions and more innovative development of arguments. The vocabulary and sentence structures are fairly basic, and there are several grammatical errors, such as inconsistencies in the spelling of ""grateful"" and issues with punctuation and capitalization. Additionally, the essay could improve its narrative flow by enhancing the use of transitional words and providing a more conversational tone. Overall, while the essay addresses some of the key points from the memoir, it would benefit from a more creative approach and a deeper analysis to fully capture the essence of Rodriguez's gratitude towards his family.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: c.The mood in this passage Narciso Rodriguez's home, nationality, and his family. He often talks about his nationality. He is proud to be born in Cuba and not afraid to say it. He is also married. He lives in the @DATE1's. In america. He also often talks about his @NUM1 bedroom apartment in Newark, New Jersey. He aslo likes to talk about the new freinds he mad here. And his family. Also Narciso childhood. His neighborhood is made out of cubans, And @CAPS1. That was the memoir of this passage.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a minimal understanding of the content about Narciso Rodriguez's background and experiences. While it mentions his Cuban nationality and pride, as well as his residence in Newark and family dynamics, it lacks specificity and depth in its supporting arguments. The response does not effectively utilize evidence from the memoir to strengthen its points, leading to a surface-level engagement with the topic. In terms of language, the essay demonstrates adequate grammar and spelling, with some minor errors and a limited range of vocabulary. The structure is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of cohesive flow between ideas, making it challenging to follow the narrative smoothly. Enhancing the originality and creativity in the development of the thesis, supporting arguments, and conclusion would greatly improve the overall quality of the essay. Additionally, incorporating a more engaging introduction and imaginative use of language and sentence structures would elevate the essay's appeal.

DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus 
by Minfong Ho 
Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng
walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist
shop to see if the plant can be purchased. 
It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat
leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in
seemingly random profusion. 
“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy
potted plant by the corner. 
There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals
splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of
recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 
“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. 
A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with
vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into
the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the
bucket. 
Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,
oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had
not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. 
When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and
cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel. 
And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with
purplish petals and white centers. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced. How strange to
see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick
walls or between tiled roofs. 
And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and
found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.
“Dok Malik,” she said,
savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its
tag, “jasmine.” 
One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed
her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could
almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she
combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng
would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. 
Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm
around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed
comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? 
A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a
channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. 
And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. 
It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the
last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.
As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of
the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to
her. 
Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. “Ghup ma laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully.
“Goodness, it’s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?” Then she noticed
the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. 
Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. “Where
did you get it?” 
“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question. 
“How much?” 
For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. 
“That’s all?” Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the 
Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .” 
“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said. 
“Then what else—?” 
“Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” 
“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously. “But how could you? All the seeds for this
vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed
the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. 
“What happened?” she asked, more gently. 
“I—I failed the test,” Saeng said. 
For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the
eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. 
Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng’s hands. “It’s a beautiful
plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.” 
“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. 
“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the
words at home, lest she burst into tears again. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said. 
“I know,” her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t
as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.
That’s what matters.” 
She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her
other hand. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said. “Let’s plant it, right now.” 
She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The
soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair
trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There
was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. 
“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. 
Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and
start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?” 
“I’d love it,” Saeng said. 
Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.
She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,
the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth
watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not
even Mrs. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.
But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. 
The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.
Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng
now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange
before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her
now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against
the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. 
When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the
geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

And his family. Also Narciso childhood. His neighborhood is made out of cubans, And @CAPS1. That was the memoir of this passage.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a minimal understanding of the content about Narciso Rodriguez's background and experiences. While it mentions his Cuban nationality and pride, as well as his residence in Newark and family dynamics, it lacks specificity and depth in its supporting arguments. The response does not effectively utilize evidence from the memoir to strengthen its points, leading to a surface-level engagement with the topic. In terms of language, the essay demonstrates adequate grammar and spelling, with some minor errors and a limited range of vocabulary. The structure is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of cohesive flow between ideas, making it challenging to follow the narrative smoothly. Enhancing the originality and creativity in the development of the thesis, supporting arguments, and conclusion would greatly improve the overall quality of the essay. Additionally, incorporating a more engaging introduction and imaginative use of language and sentence structures would elevate the essay's appeal.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Narciso Rodriguez is very grateful of his family. During this memoir he is very excited and thankful for the family he has. Like was said in the memoir ""I will always be greatful of my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 example of how Narciso show that he is greatful is ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, @CAPS2 thanked them repeatedly"". Narciso says he really has a family, that show they care. He appreciates what his parents have done for him.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a genuine effort to explore the theme of family gratitude in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, but it lacks the originality and creative expression that could elevate it. While it includes specific quotations from the memoir, the analysis remains superficial and doesn't delve deeply into the unique aspects of Rodriguez's experiences or emotions. The introduction could be more engaging, and the body paragraphs would benefit from smoother transitions and more innovative development of arguments. The vocabulary and sentence structures are fairly basic, and there are several grammatical errors, such as inconsistencies in the spelling of ""grateful"" and issues with punctuation and capitalization. Additionally, the essay could improve its narrative flow by enhancing the use of transitional words and providing a more conversational tone. Overall, while the essay addresses some of the key points from the memoir, it would benefit from a more creative approach and a deeper analysis to fully capture the essence of Rodriguez's gratitude towards his family.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created in the memoir is thoughtful and caring. ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. Narciso is very thankful and feels very much beloved in his family. In the mood in this memoir is not just thoughtful or kind or caring, it's the feeling loved and loving that feeling. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family.""

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a warm and heartfelt narrative of the author's family life, emphasizing the values of courage, love, and community. However, it lacks a clear and original thesis statement, which makes it challenging to grasp the central argument or unique perspective the writer aims to convey. The essay wanders at times, leading to a sense of disjointedness, especially in how the introduction and body paragraphs transition. The vocabulary is varied, but there are notable grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures that detract from the overall flow and coherence. While the narrative is somewhat engaging, it could benefit from more strategic use of transitional phrases to create a smoother reading experience. Additionally, while the memoir's essence is captured, more specific and consistent evidence from the provided excerpt would strengthen the arguments and maintain focus throughout the essay. Overall, the essay demonstrates potential but requires more refinement in structure, clarity, and adherence to the provided prompt.

DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 5 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Narciso Rodriguez 
from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives 
My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a 
furnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old 
Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon 
call home. 
In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the 
Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our 
traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared 
cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking 
that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which 
I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of 
childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed 
both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. 
Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that “family” had nothing to do with 
being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, 
Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation 
prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these 
cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of 
honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their 
own kind, were clearly in need. 
Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and 
Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio 
and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not 
know my “real” grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were 
allowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and 
Rosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family 
members came and went — and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they 
were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the 
many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. 
My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the 
language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a 
better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country 
they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters 
while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were 
strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind 
of jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had 
studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, 
taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their 
children to better times drove them to endure these hard times. 
I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I’ve often told them that what 
they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I’ve often told them of 
my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I’ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in 
reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at 
such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two 
lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these 
teachings have been the basis of my life. 
It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to 
this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this 
humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not 
just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of “family.” 
And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I 
learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into 
a home.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author, Narciso Rodriguez created a pleasant mood, with a family atmosphere in his memoir. First, he described his childhood home. With the great Cuban music and cuisine, his family, friends and the many celebrations, he painted a vivid image of fun and comfort. Next, he describes his neighborhood. With the many diverse cultures of all the immigrants, they work together, and kindness prevailed. The community would always extend their hands to one who was down on their luck. Third, he describes his friends and family who visited often. Their landlord and his daughter, Alegria; his surrogate grandparents Sergio and Edelmira; His aunts Bertha and Juanita; his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary; the list goes on. His parents let all who needed a home to stay with them, because they knew that the others would help them if they needed shelter. Finally Narciso described the hardships and sacrifices his parents made for him, for which he is eternally grateful. His parents left behind friends, family, and their good jobs to start anew in @LOCATION3, also that he would live a better life than they. Because of this writing style; because of his vivid imagery; Narciso Rodriguez wrote an article that is not only pleasing to read, but that it also touches the heart.

FEEDBACK: 
","Dear Student,

Thank you for your effort in writing this essay. You have done a good job in capturing the essence of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir and the various elements that contribute to the pleasant and familial atmosphere he describes. Below are some areas where you can improve to make your writing even stronger:

1. **Introduction and Thesis Statement:**
   - Your essay would benefit from a clear introduction that sets the stage for your discussion. Begin with a brief introduction to Rodriguez’s memoir and establish your thesis statement, which should indicate what you aim to discuss in your essay.

2. **Structure and Organization:**
   - The essay would be more effective if it followed a more structured format. Consider breaking it into paragraphs with clear topic sentences. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea or aspect of Rodriguez's memoir.
   - For example, one paragraph could focus on his description of his childhood home, another on the neighborhood, and so on.

3. **Details and Examples:**
   - While you provide some good examples, try to delve deeper into them. Explain how these specific details contribute to the overall mood and atmosphere of the memoir.
   - For instance, you mention the great Cuban music and cuisine; you could elaborate on how these elements evoke a sense of culture and warmth.

4. **Grammar and Punctuation:**
   - Pay attention to grammar and punctuation to make your writing clearer and more professional. For instance, ""Next, he describes his neighborhood"" should be consistent in tense with ""First, he described his childhood home.""
   - Also, phrases like ""Finally Narciso described"" need a comma after ""Finally.""

5. **Clarity and Precision:**
   - Ensure that your sentences are clear and precise. For example, the sentence ""His parents left behind friends, family, and their good jobs to start anew in @LOCATION3, also that he would live a better life than they."" could be rephrased for clarity. You might say, ""His parents left behind friends, family, and good jobs to start anew in a new location, ensuring that he would live a better life.""

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Your conclusion should summarize the main points and restate the thesis in light of the discussion in your essay. It should provide a sense of closure and reinforce the significance of Rodriguez's memoir.

Here is a revised version of your concluding sentence for better flow and clarity:
""Because of his vivid imagery and heartfelt writing style, Narciso Rodriguez crafted a memoir that is not only pleasing to read but also deeply touching to the heart.""

Overall, you have a good foundation to build upon. With some revisions, your essay will be even more compelling and insightful.
