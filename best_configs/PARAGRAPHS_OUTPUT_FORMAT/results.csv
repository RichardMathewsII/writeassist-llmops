0,2,"The essay presents several challenges that impede its effectiveness in arguing the benefits of computers. The thesis is not clearly stated, leading to confusion about the central argument. The lack of substantial evidence and logical reasoning to support the claims made further weakens the content. Additionally, the essay's organization is lacking, with a disjointed structure and abrupt transitions that make it difficult to follow the flow of ideas. The language and style are problematic, with inappropriate technical terminology and awkward sentence constructions. Common grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling and punctuation, further detract from readability. To improve, the essay should focus on articulating a clear thesis, supporting arguments with concrete data and logical reasoning, organizing ideas coherently, using precise vocabulary, and adhering to standard writing conventions.",2,"Dear Student,

Your essay clearly attempts to engage with the topic of computers and their role in society. You've made an effort to highlight both the benefits of using computers, such as looking up information and staying connected with friends and family, and some potential drawbacks. Let's go through some specific areas where your writing can be strengthened:

1. **Thesis Statement:**
   - Your thesis needs to be more precise and clearly stated. A strong thesis will provide a solid foundation for your arguments and guide your essay effectively. Consider revising your thesis to explicitly state your main argument about the benefits or drawbacks of computer usage.

2. **Evidence and Support:**
   - You mention research vaguely, which is a good start, but you need to provide more detailed and substantial evidence to support your claims. For instance, instead of saying ""Reseach shows over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 says computer is everything,"" provide specific statistics or studies that back up your point. Adding more depth and specificity will strengthen your argument and make it more convincing.

3. **Organization and Coherence:**
   - The flow of ideas in your essay is somewhat fragmented. Make sure each paragraph has a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea, followed by supporting sentences that explain and expand on the topic. Use clear transitions between ideas to enhance the overall coherence of your essay.

4. **Language Use and Precision:**
   - While your language is generally understandable, it could be more precise and varied to convey your ideas more powerfully. For instance, instead of saying ""We sure need computer to look up information these days,"" you could say, ""Computers have become essential tools for information retrieval in modern society."" This revision is more precise and impactful.

5. **Grammatical Accuracy:**
   - There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrases that need attention. For example:
     - ""dident"" should be ""didn't.""
     - ""Reseach"" should be ""Research.""
     - ""oppinion"" should be ""opinion.""
     - The sentence ""For little world neve should get to bed at least @NUM1 pm"" is unclear and needs to be rephrased for clarity.
   - Pay close attention to punctuation and capitalization to ensure your writing is technically precise. Proofreading your work can help catch these errors.

6. **Engagement and Interest:**
   - Your essay has potential, but it can be more engaging by incorporating compelling examples and anecdotes. Try to make your narrative more interesting by varying sentence structures and using vivid language.

In conclusion, your essay addresses a relevant topic, but it needs a more precise thesis, stronger evidence, better organization, more precise language, and grammatical accuracy. By focusing on these areas, you can significantly enhance the clarity, structure, and persuasiveness of your writing.

Keep working on refining these elements, and you'll see your writing improve. Great effort, and I look forward to reading your revised essay.

Best regards,

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 people use computers but not every one agress that it benefits society. In my opinion, computers benefit society. There are @CAPS1 websites that can help you find information. Computers also allow people to work easily. A third reason is @CAPS1 companies are able to use them to gain business. If you are doing a project or need to look up information about something, the internet is one of the easiest ways to find that information. Google.com has so much information

TEACHER FEEDBACK: This essay presents a clear stance on the benefits of computers to society and supports the thesis with relevant examples and logical reasoning. However, the thesis could be more precise to provide a stronger foundation for the argument. The essay is well-organized, with clear transitions between points, although the topic sentences could be more defined to enhance readability. The use of language is mostly effective, but there are moments where vocabulary could be more varied and precise to convey the intended message more powerfully. Sentence structures are generally clear and varied, contributing to a smooth flow of ideas. On the other hand, the essay has several minor grammatical errors and some issues with capitalization, which slightly impede the overall readability. Strengthening the thesis statement, refining topic sentences, and correcting grammatical errors would further enhance the clarity, structure, and content of this essay.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 these days are telling kids to go outside instead of vegging out in front of a computer. Computers can but promote bad habits. I try not to use the computer unless I have too for school or to get homework. Please consider the negative effects which are exercising in apropprate content and less interaction with friends/family. Yes internets can be used to find diets and exercise plans but if you would just go to the gym to burn of those pounds everything would be just fine!

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the negative effects of computer usage, primarily focusing on issues such as lack of exercise, exposure to inappropriate content, and reduced social interactions. However, the thesis statement lacks precision and clarity, and the arguments, though supported by personal anecdotes, are not substantiated with substantial evidence or data. The logical progression of ideas is somewhat present but fragmented, impacting the overall coherence. The structure of the essay could benefit from better-defined topic sentences and smoother transitions between paragraphs. The vocabulary used is appropriate, though there are areas where word choice could be more precise to enhance the overall message. Sentence structures are varied but occasionally awkward, which disrupts the flow of the essay. Grammatical errors, incorrect spelling, and punctuation issues are present but do not severely impede readability. Overall, while the essay conveys a personal perspective on the topic, it would benefit from stronger organization, clearer thesis articulation, and more robust evidence-based support to effectively persuade the reader.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: all you have to do is make one and then you can print out one-hundred. Using computers helps society. you can easily find what you are looking for and you are able talk to anyone you want. Also, it is easy for companies to attract business. Those are only a few of the @CAPS1 reasons why computers are good for society.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: This essay presents a clear stance on the benefits of computers to society and supports the thesis with relevant examples and logical reasoning.

TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Dear Student,

Thank you for your effort on this essay. I appreciate your enthusiasm and the points you make about the importance of computers and the internet. Here are some areas where you can improve your writing:

1. **Organization and Clarity**: Your essay needs a clear structure with an introduction, body, and conclusion. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea or point to enhance coherence.

   - **Introduction**: Start with an introductory sentence that presents the main idea of your essay. This will help set the stage for your argument.
   - **Body**: Develop each of your points in separate paragraphs, providing evidence and examples.
   - **Conclusion**: Summarize your main points and restate the importance of your argument.

2. **Grammar and Sentence Structure**: Pay attention to grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure to ensure your essay is easy to read and understand.

   - Avoid run-on sentences and sentence fragments.
   - Ensure subject-verb agreement, such as ""internet these days is very good for people"" instead of ""internet these days are very good for people.""
   - Clarify ambiguous sentences, such as ""For little world neve should get to bed at least @NUM1 pm.""

3. **Spelling and Word Choice**: Correct spelling errors and choose words that convey your ideas more precisely.

   - ""dident"" should be ""didn't.""
   - ""Reseach"" should be ""Research.""
   - ""oppinion"" should be ""opinion.""

4. **Use of Placeholders**: Replace placeholders like @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, @PERCENT1, @CAPS2, and @NUM1 with specific information. This will make your essay more concrete and less generic.

5. **Tone and Formality**: Maintain a formal tone appropriate for an academic essay.

   - Avoid conversational phrases or comments that can be perceived as informal or unclear, such as ""not trying to be mean.""

Here is a revised version of your introduction and conclusion as an example to guide you:

**Original Introduction and Conclusion**:

1,6,"The essay presents a clear stance on the issue of censoring offensive materials in libraries, but it could benefit significantly from a more structured and logical progression of ideas. The thesis is somewhat vague, and the arguments, while present, lack substantial evidence and specific examples that could strengthen the overall argument. There are instances where the writing becomes repetitive and digresses from the main point, affecting the overall coherence. The use of vocabulary is appropriate and varied, which helps in conveying the message more effectively. Sentence structures are mostly clear and varied, contributing to the readability of the essay. However, there are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that could be refined. To improve, the essay should focus on clearly defining the thesis, using concrete evidence to support arguments, and maintaining a logical flow throughout. Additionally, polishing the language and ensuring grammatical accuracy will enhance the essay's overall quality.",6,"The essay presents a clear argument in favor of restricting access to certain offensive materials in libraries, particularly focusing on the potential negative influence on children. This is a strong stance that resonates with many readers, but the argument needs further development and organization for maximum impact.

1. **Thesis Statement:**
   - Your thesis is present but could be more clearly defined. Try consolidating your main points into a single, strong thesis statement at the beginning. For example, ""Libraries should restrict access to highly offensive materials to protect children and teenagers from exposure to harmful content.""

2. **Evidence and Support:**
   - You bring up important points about the potential harm of violent and inappropriate content. However, your argument would benefit significantly from more concrete examples and evidence. Consider citing specific books or studies that support your claims about the negative impact of violent content on youth.

3. **Organization and Coherence:**
   - The essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Currently, your points are somewhat scattered. Organize your essay into clear paragraphs each focusing on a single point. For instance, one paragraph could discuss the impact of violent content on children, another could discuss the role of parental guidance, and another could focus on the responsibilities of libraries.

4. **Language Use and Precision:**
   - Your language is understandable, but there are areas where more precise vocabulary could enhance your argument. For example, instead of saying ""bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way,"" you could say ""detrimental and potentially life-altering influences.""

5. **Grammatical Accuracy:**
   - There are several grammatical errors throughout the essay that need attention. For example, ""Many shows are based of a book series"" should be ""Many shows are based on a book series."" Additionally, ensure that you are consistently using correct punctuation and capitalization. Words like ""@MONTH1"" and ""@CAPS1"" appear to be placeholders and need to be corrected.

6. **Engagement and Interest:**
   - Your essay raises important questions that are likely to engage readers. However, asking too many rhetorical questions can dilute the strength of your argument. Consider focusing on a few key questions to leave a lasting impression on your audience.

**Overall Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Refine your thesis statement for clarity and strength.
- Support your arguments with specific, concrete examples and evidence.
- Organize your essay into clear, logical paragraphs.
- Use more precise and varied vocabulary to convey your points effectively.
- Correct grammatical errors and ensure proper punctuation and capitalization throughout.
- Streamline your rhetorical questions to make a more powerful impact.

Your essay has a compelling foundation, and with these revisions, it can become a more persuasive and polished piece. Keep up the good work, and continue to refine your writing skills!","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. I believe that even if books, music, movies or magazines on the bookshelves are offense, they should still be left there. They are apart of our history and the history we're creating.     If anyone wants to read a certain book or magazine, there's a big chance they will end up reading it. There are so many ways to get to those things with the technology we have today. You could just look them up online and read them or listen to them off the

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance against the practice, advocating for the preservation of all materials regardless of their potential to offend. The central argument—that censorship is futile given technological access and potentially harmful to community dynamics—is reasonably well-articulated, though it could benefit from more specific and detailed support. The essay lacks a cohesive structure, with ideas presented in a somewhat disjointed manner. Clearer transitions and a more organized flow of arguments would enhance readability and effectiveness. The vocabulary used is appropriate and conveys the intended message, though there are some areas where more precise language could strengthen the argument. Sentence structures are varied but occasionally awkward, disrupting the overall fluidity of the text. While the essay demonstrates a good command of basic writing conventions, a few grammatical errors and inconsistencies (such as ""i've"" instead of ""I've"") need attention. Overall, the essay makes a strong case but would benefit from a more polished and systematically organized presentation.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: that could be debated about being censored.     A lot of books and movies, great ones even, contain some offensive content but they are classics. Generations, one after the other, have enjoyed them.     Now tell me, who would want to be the unreasonable person and take that away from anyone who is interested? Everyone should have the right to these books, magazines, movies, and music. Libraries should not censor them.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: With new things coming out these days, I, @PERSON1, believe that all things out in libraries should have a certain organization for certian subjects. I am not asking for any removal or destorying of books, magazines, or anything that is in the libraries but I am asking for a fair hearing of my opinion.     I would like more organization for certian things, I do know people have their own ideas about things that should be in a book. These books found in a library could bring enjoyment to people,

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear stance on the need for a more organized system in libraries to help users avoid content they may find offensive. However, the thesis lacks precision and could benefit from a more focused statement of purpose. The arguments presented are somewhat repetitive and underdeveloped, lacking substantial evidence or logical reasoning to support the proposed solution. The essay is disorganized, with ideas not flowing logically from one to the next. Transitions between paragraphs are weak, making it difficult to follow the argument. The language used is simplistic and contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors, which detract from the essay's overall effectiveness. Additionally, the sentence structures are often awkward and unclear, further impeding readability. To improve, the essay needs a clearer thesis, better-developed arguments supported by concrete evidence, a more logical organization, varied and precise word choice, and meticulous proofreading to correct language conventions.

Censorship in the Libraries 
""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken
off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then
you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books
left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, Author

Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,
should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position

overwhelming that the reader finds it difficult to focus on the message and must reread for
meaning. The writing is characterized by 
7 
•
very limited skill in using conventions. 
•
basic punctuation (including end-of-sentence punctuation) that tends to be
omitted, haphazard, or incorrect. 
•
frequent spelling errors that significantly impair readability.

capitalization that appears to be random. 
•
a need for extensive editing. 
In case of doubts 
Since some of the ratings may be close, award the LOWER grade in case there is not enough
information, i.e. that there are too few sentences / words.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: In my opinion, I do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves. These materials @MONTH1 not be offensive to some people, but it can be to others. They can be against some peoples religion and way of life.     I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf. Now they are putting those same books in libraries. These books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them. Are these books you want your children to be reading?      There are even movies that are like those books. Many shows are based of a book series, and that series @MONTH1 not be a good one. The series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers. The kids could see something they think is really neat on the @CAPS1 and then go out and try that. They do not understand that what they do @MONTH1 not be a good thing. They could get into a lot more trouble then they want to get in.     I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all. In my opinion, the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them. After that, the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them.     There are some that would agree with my opinion and some that would not. What do you think? Do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way? Would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good? Or do you want them to know what they should and should not do?
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay. You have tackled an important and relevant topic, and your passion for the subject is evident. Here are some suggestions to help you improve your essay:

1. **Clarity and Precision**:
   - Your arguments would be stronger if you provided specific examples of the ""overly offensive materials"" you mention. This would help readers understand exactly what types of content you're referring to.

2. **Consistency**:
   - Make sure your verb tenses are consistent. For example, in the first paragraph, ""These materials @MONTH1 not be offensive"" should be ""These materials may not be offensive."" Also, in the third paragraph, ""the series @MONTH1 not be a good one"" should be ""the series may not be a good one.""

3. **Grammar and Punctuation**:
   - Be careful with grammar and punctuation. For example, ""some peoples religion"" should be ""some people's religion,"" and ""more trouble then they want to get in"" should be ""more trouble than they want to get in.""

4. **Conciseness**:
   - Try to avoid repetition. For example, the repeated phrase ""these books"" can make your sentences feel redundant. Instead, use synonyms or rephrase sentences to maintain the reader's interest.

5. **Structure**:
   - Your essay could benefit from a clearer structure. Consider using an introduction to present your main argument, body paragraphs to explore your points in detail, and a conclusion to summarize your thoughts and restate your position.

6. **Balanced Viewpoint**:
   - While it's clear you feel strongly about this issue, acknowledging counterarguments and addressing them can make your essay more balanced and persuasive. This shows that you have considered different perspectives before forming your opinion.

7. **Engagement**:
   - Posing questions to the reader can be an effective way to engage them, but try to limit the number of rhetorical questions to avoid overwhelming the reader. Instead, focus on making compelling arguments that naturally lead the reader to consider your viewpoint.

Here is a revised excerpt from your essay to illustrate some of these suggestions:

---

In my opinion, we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves. While some people might not find these materials offensive, others could be deeply affected, particularly if the content clashes with their religion or way of life. I've encountered books outside of my school library that I believe should be excluded from public libraries due to their violent and inappropriate content. These are not the kinds of books I would want children to read.

Similarly, many movies and TV shows are based on book series that may not be suitable for young audiences. These series often depict violence that can influence children and teenagers. Young viewers might imitate dangerous behaviors they see on screen without understanding the potential consequences.

While some materials labeled as offensive may not be harmful, I believe the most egregious ones should be restricted to adults. This way, parents can decide what is appropriate for their children.",0.9389543631919864,0.9000503683788283
2,10,"The essay suffers from serious deficiencies in clarity, structure, and content, making it difficult to follow and understand. The response does not answer the prompt, failing to address how the features of the setting affect the cyclist and lacking any supporting evidence from the provided text. The sentences are simple and lack complexity and technical precision, with frequent grammatical errors and limited vocabulary. The narrative is disjointed, with no logical progression or cohesive flow of ideas, making it unengaging and ineffective in delivering the intended message. Overall, the essay does not meet the criteria for well-developed content, logical organization, or proficient language use.",10,"Thank you for your effort in addressing how the setting affected the cyclist. While your response touches on a central point of the cyclist's experience, it lacks the depth and specificity needed to fully support your conclusion. Let's break down areas for improvement:

1. **Thesis Statement:** Your thesis is present but could be more precise. Instead of stating, ""The setting affected the cyclist, because he didn't know if he was going to die or live,"" try refining it to clarify the specific elements of the setting that had the most significant impact. For example, ""The harsh desert setting critically affected the cyclist's physical and mental state due to extreme heat and lack of water.""

2. **Evidence and Support:** Your main points about the heat and dry mouth are on the right track but need more substantial evidence from the text. For instance, you could include specific quotes that illustrate the severity of the heat and dehydration, such as, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June...""

3. **Organization and Coherence:** Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Start with a topic sentence that introduces the main point of each paragraph. For example, ""The extreme heat of the California desert was a major challenge for the cyclist."" This sets up the paragraph to discuss specific examples and their effects in a logical order.

4. **Language Use and Precision:** Aim to use more varied and precise vocabulary to convey your ideas powerfully. Instead of saying, ""it was so hot and his mouth was dry,"" consider, ""the relentless heat caused severe dehydration, leaving his mouth parched.""

5. **Grammatical Accuracy:** Your writing would be more effective with attention to grammatical details. Ensure sentences are complete and punctuation is correctly used. For example, ""The setting affected the cyclist because he didn’t know if he was going to die or live. He had used up all his water due to the intense heat, which left his mouth dry.""

6. **Engagement and Interest:** Make your narrative more engaging by incorporating vivid descriptions and reflecting on the cyclist's emotional state. For example, ""As the sun beat down mercilessly, the cyclist's hope dwindled with every pedal stroke, highlighting the cruel irony of his situation.""

By focusing on these areas, you'll create a more compelling and well-supported essay. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to dive deeper into the text for stronger evidence. Well done on your initial effort!","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The conditions and features of the setting caused the cyclist to be tired and dehydrated and think that he was going to die from it. For example, it says and ther growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a georgus day in June. Also , he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says I  was doing a water depleting 12 mph. sometimes life could be so creul. in conclusion, this cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay on the cyclist’s experience conveys the main idea but lacks depth and detail. The thesis is somewhat clear, but the arguments supporting it are not sufficiently developed with concrete evidence or logical reasoning. The brief quotes provided from the source text are relevant but are not adequately integrated into the essay to enhance the argument. Additionally, the essay needs a more robust conclusion that synthesizes the points discussed. The organization is basic, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, but it lacks coherent transitions and well-defined topic sentences, which makes the flow of ideas somewhat choppy. The language used is simplistic and contains several grammatical errors, such as punctuation mistakes and improper use of capitalization, which detract from the overall readability and effectiveness. To improve, the essay should incorporate more substantial evidence from the text, use precise and varied vocabulary, and ensure grammatical accuracy to enhance clarity and impact.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The cyclist ran into many issues in his/her travel to @LOCATION1. They had to dismiss many hardships such as lack of water, being lost, immense desert heat, plus minor things like snakes and road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June was the most intense hardship. That and the lack of water. Though the heat starting powing at the cyclists brain by making them see mirages, etc. The heat and entire setting made the cyclists travel much harder.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a general overview of the cyclist's hardships during their journey through the California desert, mentioning issues such as extreme heat, lack of water, and challenging terrain. While the central idea is identifiable, it lacks depth and specificity, requiring more substantial evidence and detailed examples to bolster the main points. The essay's organization is somewhat disjointed, with ideas not fully fleshed out or logically connected, leading to a lack of smooth narrative flow. Transitional phrases and topic sentences are sparse, which hampers the coherence and fluidity of the text. Furthermore, the language used is basic and occasionally imprecise, with some grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures that detract from the overall readability. Enhancing the clarity of arguments, providing more detailed examples, and polishing the language would significantly improve the effectiveness of the essay.

DOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit 
by Joe Kurmaskie 
FORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece 
of advice for the solo cyclist would be, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers 
who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” It’s not that a group of 
old guys doesn’t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid 
place. Things change. 
At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer 
evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn’t have done was 
let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice 
and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to 
Yosemite National Park. 
They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I 
would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with 
strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town.” 
This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time—say, before the last world war—but 
on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water 
supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool 
pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. 
Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, 
and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had 
been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of 
California in June. 
I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my 
strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the 
neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water 
wouldn’t cool down. It didn’t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. 
The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make 
that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so—a test of my inner spirit. 
Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was 
replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign 
jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. 
The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so 
cruel. 
I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it 
really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased 
past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. 
The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my 
shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June 
simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, 
caused me to laugh. 
It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. 
There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride 
down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d 
be fine. 
Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make 
sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst 
of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. 
In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building—abandoned years 
earlier, by the looks of it—had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A 
sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still 
be seen. 
I hung my head. 
That smoky blues tune “Summertime” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating 
brain. 
I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. 
I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you 
have left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. 
It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some 
expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and 
their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I 
was going to lose consciousness for the last time. 
Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining 
elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear 
were all behind me. 
GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP—IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE 
YOUR BEST BET! 
“And the only bet,” I remember thinking. 
As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an 
overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait—any bait, even 
though I didn’t own a rod or reel. 
An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from 
my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. 
“Where you headed in such a hurry?” 
“Yosemite,” I whispered. 
“Know the best way to get there?” 
I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group 
I’d listened to in Lodi. 
“Yes, sir! I own a very good map.” 
And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The setting affected the cyclist, because he didnt know if he was going to die or live. He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for submitting your essay. Here is some feedback that aligns with our values of clarity, detail, and expressive writing:

1. **Clarity and Detail**: Your essay has a good start by introducing the setting and its impact on the cyclist. However, it could be more detailed. For instance, instead of saying ""the setting affected the cyclist,"" you could describe how the harsh, hot environment took a toll on him both physically and mentally.

2. **Expressive Language**: Try to use more expressive language to convey the urgency and desperation the cyclist felt. Words like ""parched,"" ""scorching,"" and ""desperate"" can help paint a vivid picture for the reader.

3. **Structure and Flow**: Your essay would benefit from a smoother flow. Consider breaking it into sentences that connect more fluidly. For example, instead of ""He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry,"" you could write, ""The relentless heat had drained all his water supplies, leaving his mouth parched and his body desperate for hydration.""

4. **Emotional Impact**: Reflect more on the emotional journey of the cyclist. How did he feel as he realized he might not survive? Did he have any moments of hope or despair?

Here’s a revised version incorporating these suggestions:
""The unforgiving heat beat down on the cyclist, each mile feeling more grueling under the blazing sun. With every passing minute, his uncertainty grew—would he make it out alive? His water bottles were empty, drained by the relentless sun, leaving his mouth dry and his body screaming for relief. As the harsh reality set in, a wave of desperation washed over him, punctuated by fleeting moments of hope and overwhelming fear.""

Keep working on expanding your ideas and using descriptive language. You're on the right track, and with some more detail and expressive language, your writing will become even more engaging and powerful. Great effort!",0.8897007375653421,0.8940989331103052
3,13,"The essay ""So she did not forget to take the test again"" does not address any of the given prompts, nor does it provide relevant content or context. It lacks a clear thesis, supporting arguments, and a conclusion. The single sentence provided does not demonstrate any logical progression of ideas or evidence-based arguments. Furthermore, its language is overly simplistic and does not utilize technical terminology or complex sentence structures. The conventions of grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization are not applicable here due to the minimal content. To improve, the essay needs to directly address the prompt, develop a clear thesis, support arguments with evidence, organize ideas coherently, and employ appropriate language and technical precision.",13,"Thank you for your brief response. However, it significantly lacks the depth and detail required to address the essay prompt effectively. Here are several areas where your response can be improved:

1. **Thesis Statement:** Your response does not include a clear thesis statement. A strong thesis should articulate why the author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring. Consider starting with a sentence that clearly states your main argument, setting the stage for the rest of your essay.

2. **Evidence and Support:** Your response is very brief and does not provide any supporting evidence from the story. To strengthen your argument, you need to include specific examples and details from ""Winter Hibiscus"" that explain why Saeng's vow is significant. For instance, discuss the symbolism of the hibiscus and the geese, and how Saeng's experiences and emotions throughout the story lead to her determination to try again.

3. **Organization and Coherence:** The response lacks structure. A well-organized essay should have an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Each paragraph should have a clear topic sentence and smooth transitions to guide the reader through your argument. 

4. **Language Use and Precision:** The vocabulary in your response is very basic. Aim to use more varied and precise language to convey your ideas more powerfully. Descriptive language and technical terminology appropriate to the story and its themes will strengthen your analysis.

5. **Grammatical Accuracy:** Although your sentence is grammatically correct, more complex sentence structures can enhance the readability and interest of your essay. Ensure that you avoid overly simplistic language and consider varying your sentence lengths and types.

6. **Engagement and Interest:** Your response is quite terse and does not engage the reader. To make your essay more compelling, weave in elements that draw the reader into Saeng's emotional journey and the broader themes of the text. 

Here is an example of how you might start your improved response:

""Saeng's vow to retake the driving test in the spring epitomizes her resilience and hope for the future, despite the difficulties she faces as an immigrant adjusting to a new life in the United States. The concluding paragraph of 'Winter Hibiscus' highlights the significance of the hibiscus and the geese as symbols of Saeng's connection to her past and her determination to succeed in her new environment.""

By expanding on this idea and providing specific examples from the text, your essay will become more detailed, structured, and convincing.

Keep working on developing your thesis, supporting your arguments with evidence, organizing your thoughts clearly, and using precise language to improve your writing skills. I am confident that with practice, you will be able to construct well-reasoned, evidence-based arguments.","

DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus 
by Minfong Ho 
Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng
walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist
shop to see if the plant can be purchased. 
It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat
leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in
seemingly random profusion. 
“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy
potted plant by the corner. 
There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals
splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of
recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 
“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. 
A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with
vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into
the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the
bucket. 
Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,
oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had
not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. 
When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and
cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel. 
And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with
purplish petals and white centers. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced. How strange to
see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick
walls or between tiled roofs. 
And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and
found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.
“Dok Malik,” she said,
savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its
tag, “jasmine.” 
One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed
her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could
almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she
combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng
would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. 
Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm
around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed
comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? 
A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a
channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. 
And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. 
It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the
last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.
As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of
the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to
her. 
Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. “Ghup ma laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully.
“Goodness, it’s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?” Then she noticed
the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. 
Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. “Where
did you get it?” 
“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question. 
“How much?” 
For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. 
“That’s all?” Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the 
Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .” 
“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said. 
“Then what else—?” 
“Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” 
“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously. “But how could you? All the seeds for this
vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed
the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. 
“What happened?” she asked, more gently. 
“I—I failed the test,” Saeng said. 
For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the
eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. 
Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng’s hands. “It’s a beautiful
plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.” 
“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. 
“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the
words at home, lest she burst into tears again. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said. 
“I know,” her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t
as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.
That’s what matters.” 
She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her
other hand. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said. “Let’s plant it, right now.” 
She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The
soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair
trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There
was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. 
“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. 
Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and
start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?” 
“I’d love it,” Saeng said. 
Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.
She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,
the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth
watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not
even Mrs. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.
But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. 
The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.
Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng
now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange
before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her
now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against
the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. 
When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the
geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: So she did not forget to take the test again.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Of course! Here is some constructive feedback for the student's essay:

---

Dear Student,

Thank you for your effort in writing this essay. Here are some points to consider for improvement:

1. **Clarity and Completeness**: Your sentence is a bit vague and leaves the reader wanting more information. Try to provide more context and details to make your writing clearer and more comprehensive. For example, who is ""she""? What test is being referred to?

2. **Grammar and Structure**: The sentence structure could be improved. It seems to be a dependent clause rather than a complete sentence. Consider revising it to form a complete thought. For example, ""She remembered to take the test this time because she set a reminder.""

3. **Engagement and Depth**: Adding more depth and engagement can make your writing more interesting. Think about including why it was important for her not to forget the test and what strategies she used to remember.

4. **Positive Framing**: Instead of focusing on the negative aspect of not forgetting, you could frame it positively. For example, ""She successfully remembered to take the test this time.""

Remember, good writing provides clear information, engages the reader, and is well-structured. Keep practicing, and you will continue to improve!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

4,14,"The essay struggles with clarity and cohesion, particularly in the initial section, where the thesis statement is vague and lacks precision. The arguments are not well-supported by specific evidence from the memoir, resulting in a weak overall content. The understanding of the text is moderate, and while there is some alignment with the prompt, the response often strays off topic. The language used contains multiple grammatical errors, including issues with spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which hinder the readability and overall quality of the essay. The vocabulary is limited and repetitive, further impacting the essay's effectiveness. In terms of organization, the essay lacks logical structure and clear transitions, making it somewhat disjointed. While there are some attempts at linking ideas, they are not consistent, leading to a narrative that is difficult to follow and less engaging for the reader. Overall, the essay requires significant improvement in clarity, content development, language accuracy, and organizational coherence to meet the outlined guidelines.",14,"Your essay demonstrates an initial grasp of the themes in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, with a focus on the gratitude and pride the author feels towards his parents. However, there are several areas where refinement could significantly improve your work.

**Thesis Statement:** Your thesis statement is currently unclear and somewhat fragmented. To provide a strong foundation for your essay, consider crafting a more precise thesis that clearly states the mood you will be discussing and how it is conveyed through the memoir. For example, you might say, ""In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the dominant moods are gratitude and pride, as demonstrated through his reflections on his parents' sacrifices and their compassionate actions.""

**Evidence and Support:** While you reference several relevant points from the memoir, your evidence could be more specific and detailed. For instance, instead of simply stating that the parents ""let people live at their house,"" you could include more vivid examples such as how ""Alegria, the landlord's daughter, often joined them at their kitchen table, symbolizing the warmth and inclusiveness of their household."" This will strengthen your argument and provide a clearer connection between your points and the text.

**Organization and Coherence:** The structure of your essay needs improvement to enhance readability. Currently, your ideas are somewhat disjointed, making it hard to follow your argument. Organize your essay into clear paragraphs, each focused on a single main point. Use transitional phrases to connect your thoughts smoothly. For example, you could start a new paragraph with, ""Moreover, the memoir highlights the parents' resilience and perseverance in the face of cultural and financial challenges.""

**Language Use and Precision:** Your essay would benefit from more varied and precise language. Avoid repetitive phrases and consider using more sophisticated vocabulary to convey your ideas. For instance, instead of saying ""they had a three-bedroom apartment,"" you could say, ""they managed to secure a modest, three-room apartment that became a haven for family and friends.""

**Grammatical Accuracy:** There are several grammatical errors in your essay that need correction. Ensure you use correct verb forms, subject-verb agreement, and possessive pronouns. For example, ""there"" should be ""their,"" and ""the could get"" should be ""they could get."" These corrections will enhance the overall clarity and professionalism of your writing.

**Engagement and Interest:** To make your essay more engaging, try to incorporate more descriptive and evocative storytelling techniques. Highlight moments in the memoir that vividly illustrate the mood you are discussing. For instance, you could describe how ""the aromas of Cuban cuisine, mingled with the sounds of passionate music, created a vibrant and loving atmosphere in their home.""

In summary, your essay shows potential, but it requires a clearer thesis, more specific evidence, better organization, precise language, grammatical accuracy, and engaging storytelling. By addressing these areas, you can craft a more compelling and effective analysis of the mood in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir. Keep working on these aspects, and you'll surely see improvement","

Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author shows many moods while writing this memoir, like gratitude, happiness, and love. The main mood in this memoir however is gratitude. @ORGANIZATION1 is very grateful for everything his parents have ever done for him and he loves them with all his heart. Also he is grateful for how they always made him safe. In the last sentence Narciso says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."", what this means is that he is greatful for the life he had. So he will

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the memoir's main theme of gratitude, with specific references to Narciso Rodriguez’s experiences and emotions towards his parents. The thesis is reasonably clear, focused on the idea of gratitude, and supported with relevant examples from the memoir. However, the clarity of the thesis could be enhanced with a more precise statement at the beginning. The structure of the essay shows logical progression, with well-defined paragraphs and a coherent flow of ideas, though some transitions could be smoother to enhance readability. The use of technical terminology and vocabulary is appropriate, and the sentence structures are varied and generally correct, though there are minor grammatical errors that could be refined for higher precision. The conclusion effectively synthesizes the arguments presented, reinforcing the theme of gratitude and the impact of the parents' sacrifices on the author's life. Overall, the essay is engaging and maintains the reader's interest, with good use of evidence from the memoir to support its points. To improve, the essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement, smoother transitions, and minor grammatical corrections.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created by the author in this memoir was nostalgic. @PERSON1 remembers all the happy times he had, and memories that took place in his home. In paragraph two, he reflects back on how in his traditional Cuban home, where the heart was the kitchen.

In paragraph three and four, he tells how the

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay effectively captures the nostalgic mood of the memoir through detailed reflections on the author's memories with substantial evidence drawn directly from the text. The clear and well-supported thesis regarding the nostalgic atmosphere is consistently backed by specific examples, such as the vivid descriptions of the Cuban kitchen, the familial gatherings, and the cultural solidarity in the neighborhood. The narrative flows logically from one point to the next, with each paragraph building on the previous one to create a cohesive and compelling story. Moreover, the use of technical terminology and a varied, precise vocabulary enhances the readability and depth of the essay.

Additionally, the essay maintains grammatical accuracy, with minimal errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, ensuring that the content is delivered effectively. Overall, the essay demonstrates a strong alignment with the guidelines, showcasing evidence-based arguments, logical progression, and linguistic precision.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful. The author proved that it doesn't take the amount of money, or how big your house is to be happy. Sometimes its just the simple things. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The author is showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood, they still treat each other as if they were.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a general understanding of the memoir's themes, but it lacks a precise and clear thesis statement, resulting in an overall vague argument. While there are some references to specific passages in the memoir, they are not well integrated into the argument, and the connection between the evidence and the points being made is not sufficiently established. The structure of the essay is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of coherent flow from one idea to the next. Additionally, the use of language is basic, with limited vocabulary and several grammatical errors that detract from the overall readability and effectiveness of the essay. The narrative struggles to hold the reader's interest due to its repetitive nature and lack of engaging storytelling techniques. To improve, the essay should focus on developing a clear thesis, integrating evidence seamlessly into the argument, enhancing the logical flow with better transitions, and refining language use to be more varied and precise.

DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 5 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Narciso Rodriguez 
from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives 
My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a 
furnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old 
Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon 
call home. 
In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the 
Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our 
traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared 
cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking 
that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which 
I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of 
childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed 
both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. 
Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that “family” had nothing to do with 
being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, 
Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation 
prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these 
cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of 
honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their 
own kind, were clearly in need. 
Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and 
Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio 
and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not 
know my “real” grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were 
allowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and 
Rosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family 
members came and went — and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they 
were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the 
many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. 
My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the 
language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a 
better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country 
they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters 
while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were 
strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind 
of jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had 
studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, 
taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their 
children to better times drove them to endure these hard times. 
I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I’ve often told them that what 
they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I’ve often told them of 
my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I’ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in 
reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at 
such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two 
lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these 
teachings have been the basis of my life. 
It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to 
this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this 
humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not 
just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of “family.” 
And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I 
learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into 
a home.

FEEDBACK: 
","FEEDBACK:

Dear Student,

Thank you for submitting your essay. I appreciate the effort you have put into conveying the mood of the author and the story surrounding his parents’ journey from Cuba. Here are some areas of improvement along with suggestions to help you strengthen your writing:

1. **Clarity and Grammar**:
   - There are several grammatical errors in your essay. For example, ""there house"" should be ""their house,"" and ""the took any job"" should be ""they took any job.""
   - Ensure that you use proper punctuation throughout your essay. For instance, ""When the didnt have much money,"" should be ""When they didn't have much money,...""
   - It's important to maintain consistency in your verb tenses. For example, ""they had a three-bedroom apartment and they let refugees celebrate"" should be ""they had a three-bedroom apartment and let refugees celebrate.""

2. **Structure and Flow**:
   - Your essay could benefit from a more structured format with clear introductory and concluding paragraphs.
   - Consider breaking down your ideas into separate paragraphs to enhance readability. For example, you could have one paragraph discussing the parents' journey and struggles, and another discussing how they supported others.

3. **Mood and Tone**:
   - You mentioned that the mood is ""grateful,"" but you also said it is ""proud."" It would be helpful to focus on a single mood to create a more cohesive argument. You could elaborate on how the actions of the parents reflect this mood.
   - Instead of using placeholders like ""@CAPS1"", make sure to clearly describe the mood with precise language.

4. **Specificity and Detail**:
   - Provide specific examples or anecdotes to illustrate the mood more effectively. For example, describe a particular instance where the parents' kindness made a significant impact on someone’s life.
   - Explain how the parents' actions and sacrifices made the author feel proud and grateful, offering more insight into their experiences.

5. **Language and Expression**:
   - Enhance your vocabulary and expression to make your essay more engaging. For example, instead of saying ""they had their house full of love and life,"" you could say ""their home was a sanctuary brimming with love and vitality.""
   - Avoid repetitive phrases and ensure each sentence adds new information or perspective to your essay.

Here is a revised version of your introductory sentence to illustrate these improvements:

""The mood of the author is one of pride and gratitude, stemming from the remarkable resilience and kindness of his parents who left Cuba. Despite facing numerous hardships, they welcomed others into their home and tirelessly worked any job they could find to provide for their son, Narciso.""

Overall, your essay has a strong foundation, but refining these areas will greatly enhance its quality. Keep up the good work, and continue to develop your writing skills.

5,18,"The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the central theme of gratitude in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, providing specific excerpts from the text to support the points made about the author's appreciation for his parents. The thesis is clear, though it could be more precisely stated. The overall argument is backed by relevant evidence, but some parts of the essay repeat similar points, indicating a need for more concise and varied support. The structure of the essay is logical, with a beginning that introduces the topic, a middle that provides supporting details, and an end that reiterates the main argument. However, better use of transitional phrases and topic sentences would enhance the flow of ideas and coherence. The language used is fairly clear but contains multiple grammatical errors, including spelling mistakes and improper capitalization, which detract from the overall readability. Additionally, the vocabulary is somewhat limited and repetitive, and more precise terminology could improve clarity and engagement. Overall, while the essay shows a solid grasp of the memoir's themes and provides relevant evidence, it would benefit from more refined language and a stronger organizational structure.",18,"Thank you for your effort in analyzing the mood in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir. Here are some detailed points on how to enhance your essay:

1. **Thesis Statement:**
   - Your thesis is clear, focusing on the mood of gratitude. However, it could be more precise and explicitly stated at the beginning of your essay. Consider starting with a sentence like, ""The memoir 'Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' by Narciso Rodriguez primarily conveys a mood of gratitude.""

2. **Evidence and Support:**
   - You’ve selected relevant quotes that support the theme of gratitude. However, try to integrate the quotes more seamlessly into your analysis. For example, instead of isolating the quote, you might say, ""Rodriguez expresses his gratitude through vivid memories of his parents, stating, 'My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today.' This demonstrates how deeply he values the skills and passions they instilled in him.""
   - Additionally, ensure that each piece of evidence you present is clearly linked to your central argument. Avoid repetitive explanations and strive for depth by discussing the significance of these memories in shaping Rodriguez's sense of gratitude.

3. **Organization and Coherence:**
   - Your essay needs a more logical progression of ideas. Start with a strong introductory paragraph that presents your thesis. Then, structure your body paragraphs around specific aspects of gratitude, such as the parents' sacrifices, the cultural heritage they passed on, and the sense of family and community.
   - Use clear topic sentences at the beginning of each paragraph to guide the reader through your argument.

4. **Language Use and Precision:**
   - Your vocabulary is somewhat basic, and there are a few spelling and grammatical errors. For instance, ""unwrittingly"" should be ""unwittingly,"" and ""besis"" should be ""basis."" Proofread your work to avoid these mistakes and consider using more varied and precise language to enhance your analysis.
   - Instead of repeating phrases like ""he loves and cherishes his mom and dad,"" try using synonyms or more descriptive language to convey the same idea.

5. **Grammatical Accuracy:**
   - Pay attention to capitalization, especially with words like ""Parents"" and ""Passed,"" which should be lowercase unless they start a sentence. Also, ensure subject-verb agreement and proper punctuation.
   - For example, ""What I mean by that is that he is grateful for what he learned from is parents"" should be ""What I mean by that is that he is grateful for what he learned from his parents.""

6. **Engagement and Interest:**
   - While your essay addresses the theme of gratitude, it can be more engaging by incorporating more varied sentence structures and storytelling techniques. Aim to create a narrative that holds the reader's interest and vividly conveys Rodriguez's emotions and experiences.

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author shows many moods while writing this memoir, like gratitude, happiness, and love. The main mood in this memoir however is gratitude. @ORGANIZATION1 is very grateful for everything his parents have ever done for him and he loves them with all his heart. Also he is grateful for how they always made him safe. In the last sentence Narciso says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."", what this means is that he is greatful for the life he had. So he will

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the memoir's main theme of gratitude, with specific references to Narciso Rodriguez’s experiences and emotions towards his parents. The thesis is reasonably clear, focused on the idea of gratitude, and supported with relevant examples from the memoir. However, the clarity of the thesis could be enhanced with a more precise statement at the beginning. The structure of the essay shows logical progression, with well-defined paragraphs and a coherent flow of ideas, though some transitions could be smoother to enhance readability. The use of technical terminology and vocabulary is appropriate, and the sentence structures are varied and generally correct, though there are minor grammatical errors that could be refined for higher precision. The conclusion effectively synthesizes the arguments presented, reinforcing the theme of gratitude and the impact of the parents' sacrifices on the author's life. Overall, the essay is engaging and maintains the reader's interest, with good use of evidence from the memoir to support its points. To improve, the essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement, smoother transitions, and minor grammatical corrections.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful. The author proved that it doesn't take the amount of money, or how big your house is to be happy. Sometimes its just the simple things. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The author is showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood, they still treat each other as if they were.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a general understanding of the memoir's themes, but it lacks a precise and clear thesis statement, resulting in an overall vague argument. While there are some references to specific passages in the memoir, they are not well integrated into the argument, and the connection between the evidence and the points being made is not sufficiently established. The structure of the essay is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of coherent flow from one idea to the next. Additionally, the use of language is basic, with limited vocabulary and several grammatical errors that detract from the overall readability and effectiveness of the essay. The narrative struggles to hold the reader's interest due to its repetitive nature and lack of engaging storytelling techniques. To improve, the essay should focus on developing a clear thesis, integrating evidence seamlessly into the argument, enhancing the logical flow with better transitions, and refining language use to be more varied and precise.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created by the author in this memoir was nostalgic. @PERSON1 remembers all the happy times he had, and memories that took place in his home. In paragraph two, he reflects back on how in his traditional Cuban home, where the heart was the kitchen. He remembers his parents love for cooking, and how eternally grateful he is it got passed down to him. @PERSON1 remembers the passionate Cuban music mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. In paragraph three and four, he tells how the

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay effectively captures the nostalgic mood of the memoir through detailed reflections on the author's memories with substantial evidence drawn directly from the text. The clear and well-supported thesis regarding the nostalgic atmosphere is consistently backed by specific examples, such as the vivid descriptions of the Cuban kitchen, the familial gatherings, and the cultural solidarity in the neighborhood. The narrative flows logically from one point to the next, with each paragraph building on the previous one to create a cohesive and compelling story. Moreover, the use of technical terminology and a varied, precise vocabulary enhances the readability and depth of the essay. The sentence structures are complex yet clear, contributing to an engaging and sophisticated writing style. Additionally, the essay maintains grammatical accuracy, with minimal errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, ensuring that the content is delivered effectively. Overall, the essay demonstrates a strong alignment with the guidelines, showcasing evidence-based arguments, logical progression, and linguistic precision.

DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 5 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Narciso Rodriguez 
from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives 
My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a 
furnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old 
Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon 
call home. 
In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the 
Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our 
traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared 
cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking 
that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which 
I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of 
childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed 
both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. 
Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that “family” had nothing to do with 
being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, 
Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation 
prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these 
cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of 
honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their 
own kind, were clearly in need. 
Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and 
Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio 
and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not 
know my “real” grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were 
allowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and 
Rosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family 
members came and went — and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they 
were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the 
many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. 
My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the 
language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a 
better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country 
they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters 
while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were 
strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind 
of jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had 
studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, 
taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their 
children to better times drove them to endure these hard times. 
I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I’ve often told them that what 
they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I’ve often told them of 
my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I’ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in 
reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at 
such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two 
lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these 
teachings have been the basis of my life. 
It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to 
this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this 
humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not 
just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of “family.” 
And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I 
learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into 
a home.

FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay. It's clear that you grasp the theme of gratitude in the memoir and have made a commendable effort to explain this through your examples. Here are some specific points of feedback to help you improve and refine your writing:

1. **Clarity and Consistency**:
   - Your opening statement is clear, but make sure to consistently capitalize proper nouns and key terms. For example, ""Parents"" should only be capitalized at the beginning of the sentence or when referring to them as specific individuals (e.g., ""my parents"" vs. ""My Parents"").
   - Be careful with spelling and grammar. ""Unwrittingly"" should be ""unwittingly,"" and ""besis"" should be ""basis.""

2. **Quotation Integration**:
   - When incorporating quotes, ensure they are seamlessly integrated into your sentences. For example, you could write: ""The author expresses his gratitude by saying, 'My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today.'""

3. **Explanation and Analysis**:
   - After presenting a quote, delve deeper into its significance. Instead of repeating the idea that he is grateful, explore how these experiences shaped his character or life choices. For instance, you could elaborate on how the love of cooking influenced his personal or professional life.

4. **Avoid Redundancy**:
   - Try not to repeat the same idea multiple times. It’s clear from your examples that the mood is grateful. Focus on providing a variety of evidence or exploring different facets of his gratitude.

5. **Structure and Flow**:
   - Organize your essay to have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. Start with an introductory sentence that states the mood and follow with body paragraphs that provide evidence and analysis. Conclude with a summary that reinforces your main points.

Here is a revised version of your essay to consider:

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students in @NUM3 grade go on the computer each night to complete homework and to connect with friends and family? I think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. A computer can be used for communication, education, and for accessing important information quickly, such as the local news. Now, let me tell you why computers are good for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a friend who I was very close to and a part of his life. Unfortunately, he had to move away. But I still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while. A convenient way to do this was by using a computer. The computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can @CAPS5 stay in touch. Different types of communication on the computer can be e-mail, instant-messaging, video chat, online chat groups...etc. This helps people stay connected. That's why I think communication is the biggest effect on people due to the use of a computer. But, a computer can also be used for learning. At school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals. For example when my class researched different things about the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, our main source of infromation was the internet on our computers. We researched the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. Also, kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it. This is teaching them hand-eye coordiantion, and how to type. The computer is not @CAPS5 used for just communication. It's a good way to educate everyone although the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information. ""@CAPS6 and adults often check their e-mail and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy, ""says expert @PERSON1. I think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what's going on in our town, state, country, and world. For example, it can tell us about the series of shootings goiong on throughout @LOCATION1 or the many house robberies in our town. Us, @CAPS7 citizens, wnt to know everything... for us to stay safe and notified on the latest. Another example is that I logged on the computer three dats ago and it notified me about the earthquake in @LOCATION2. But there are so many benefits of a computer. The effects computers have on people are beneficial. It allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news. I think you should take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Certainly! Here is constructive feedback for the student's essay:

---

**Feedback:**

**Introduction and Overall Argument:**
- You have presented a clear argument that computers are beneficial due to their uses in communication, education, and accessing information. This is a strong thesis that sets up your essay well.

**Structure and Organization:**
- The essay is generally well-organized, with different paragraphs focusing on the specific benefits of computers. However, you could improve the flow by using clearer transitions between paragraphs. For example, starting the paragraph about education with a phrase like ""In addition to communication, computers also play a crucial role in education"" can make your writing more cohesive.

**Content and Examples:**
- Your examples, such as maintaining a friendship through computer communication and using the internet for school research, are relatable and support your points well. Including a real-life expert quote adds credibility to your argument.
- However, some parts of the essay contain placeholder text like @CAPS1, @NUM1, @PERSON1, and @LOCATION1. Ensure to replace these with actual names, numbers, and locations to strengthen your argument and make it more concrete.

**Language and Expression:**
- Your language is mostly clear and straightforward, which is good. However, pay attention to typos and misspellings. For example, ""coordiantion"" should be ""coordination,"" and ""goiong"" should be ""going."" Proofreading your essay will help catch these errors.
- There is a repetition of the phrase ""not only used for communication"" which can be rephrased for variety. Consider using synonyms or restructuring the sentence to avoid redundancy.

**Grammar and Punctuation:**
- Be mindful of grammar and punctuation errors. For instance, ""Us, @CAPS7 citizens, wnt to know everything..."" should be ""We, as citizens, want to know everything..."" 
- Check the use of capital letters (e.g., ""infromation"" should be ""information"") and ensure proper nouns are capitalized (e.g., ""earthquake in @LOCATION2"").

**Conclusion:**
- Your conclusion effectively summarizes the main points of your essay and reiterates why computers are beneficial. However, it could be more impactful by briefly restating the primary benefits mentioned in a succinct manner.

**Final Thoughts:**
- Overall, you have a strong foundation and clear ideas. With some attention to detail and refinement, your essay can be even more compelling. Keep up the good work and continue to develop your writing skills!

7,23,"The essay presents a clear and emotionally resonant thesis that argues for the continuation of current censorship practices in libraries, effectively holding the reader’s attention throughout. The development of ideas is supported by specific anecdotes and logical reasoning, although it would benefit from more vivid details to further deepen the emotional impact. The organization is strong, beginning with an engaging introduction and following through with well-structured body paragraphs that flow logically, enhancing the overall readability and emotional connection. While the word choice is generally effective and appropriate, it could be more varied and expressive to fully convey the intended emotional resonance. The sentence structures are varied and contribute to a smooth and engaging flow, making the essay easy and enjoyable to read. The essay demonstrates a strong control of conventions, with minimal grammatical errors that do not detract from the overall communication. Overall, the essay effectively combines clear organization, emotional resonance, and control of language, though there is room for further enhancement in word choice to elevate the emotional expressiveness.",23,"Your essay presents a thoughtful perspective on censorship in libraries, emphasizing a balanced approach to maintaining freedom of access while considering public sentiment. You've done a commendable job in articulating your main argument, and your inclusion of personal observations, such as the organization of your local library, adds an authentic touch to your narrative.

**Strengths:**

1. **Clear Thesis and Well-Defined Stance:** Your position on the current system of censorship is clearly stated, and you maintain this stance consistently throughout the essay. This clarity helps the reader understand your viewpoint from the outset.

2. **Use of Personal Observations:** Including specific details about your local library's organization enhances the essay's authenticity and makes your argument more relatable and tangible.

3. **Historical Context:** You effectively address the importance of considering the time and place of a story's origin when evaluating offensive content. This insight demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the subject matter.

4. **Balanced Argument:** Your acknowledgment of the need for some level of restriction, particularly regarding extremely harmful materials, shows a balanced approach to the topic, adding credibility to your argument.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Emotional Resonance and Expressiveness:** While your essay is logically sound, it could benefit from more emotional depth to truly engage the reader. Consider sharing a personal anecdote or a vivid description that conveys your feelings about the importance of access to diverse materials in libraries. This would enhance the emotional impact of your writing.

2. **Transitions and Flow:** The flow between paragraphs could be smoother. Try using more varied transitional phrases to guide the reader seamlessly from one point to the next. This will improve the overall coherence and readability of your essay.

3. **Varied Sentence Structures:** While your sentences are generally clear, incorporating more varied sentence structures could add rhythm and energy to your writing. Experiment with combining shorter, impactful sentences with longer, more descriptive ones to create a more engaging narrative.

4. **Word Choice:** Some of your word choices could be more precise and evocative to better capture the reader's attention. For instance, instead of ""the book usually is taken off of the shelves,"" you could say ""the book is often removed from the shelves."" Small changes like this can make your writing more vivid and impactful.

5. **Concluding Thoughts:** Your conclusion reiterates your main points well, but it could be strengthened by offering a compelling closing thought or call to action. Encourage the reader to reflect on their own views about censorship or suggest a specific way to engage with the issue.

**Specific Feedback:**

- **Offensive Material Placement:** The sentence ""At my local library, their is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place"" contains a typo. ""Their"" should be ""there."" Additionally, consider using more descriptive language here to paint a clearer picture of this section in the reader's mind.

- **Historical Context Paragraph:** The names and details in the sentence ""@PERSON3 @PERSON2 @MONTH","

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a mix of clear ideas and interesting reflections on the impact of computers on society, but it lacks depth and specificity in parts, making some points feel underdeveloped.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I believe the current way materials are censored and removed works, and should continue. While everyone @MONTH1 dislike a particular novel or book, libraries can not remove every book a person dislikes, as Katherine Paterson said. When a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it, then the book usually is taken off of the shelves.     The possibility children will see the offensve material appears unlikely. Most public libraries do not put their offensive material near the childrens books. At my local library, their is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place. To acquire these books you must have a parents permission or be @NUM1 years of age. It is very unlikely a child would ever see the materials in question.     Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated. @PERSON3 @PERSON2 @MONTH1 have had racial slurs in it, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were normal for the time. Someone can not be frustrated with a novel written @NUM2 years ago because it has something offensive in it by todays standards.     While I believe, for the most part, libraries should not censor or remove materials, there should be some restrictions set in place to keep extremely harmful materials out of libraries. For instance, libraries should not have dirty magazines or movies on their shelves. If a high majority of people want a particular material banned, then it is hard to ignore them. When a book is so vulgar people begin to protest the book, there are questions as to whether the book should remain on library shelves. When a high percentage of people join that cause, then it should be banned.     Censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today. I believe the current system in place to censor or remove books does its job, and that it should continue. If few people disapprove of a particular material, the book remains in most shelves uncensored. When a lot of people begin to protest that same material, it has a high probability of being banned. With this process, every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not removed, while the ones that truly deserve it are removed.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","**FEEDBACK:**

Thank you for your essay on the topic of censorship and the removal of materials from libraries. You've provided a clear perspective and supported your argument with specific examples and reasoning. Here are some areas for improvement and commendation:

1. **Clarity and Organization**:
   - Your essay is well-organized into paragraphs that each focus on a specific aspect of the topic. This aids readability and helps the reader follow your argument. 
   - Consider using more transitional phrases to enhance the flow between your paragraphs.

2. **Specificity and Detail**:
   - You provide a good example with your local library having a section for more offensive or obscene books. However, you could benefit from more specific examples or case studies to strengthen your argument.

3. **Language and Formality**:
   - There are a few grammatical errors and typos that need addressing. For instance, ""their is a section"" should be ""there is a section,"" and ""offensve"" should be ""offensive.""
   - The use of placeholders like ""@MONTH1"" and ""@NUM1"" should be replaced with actual months and numbers to make your essay more precise and professional.

4. **Arguments and Reasoning**:
   - Your argument that libraries should not remove materials based on the dislike of a few individuals is strong and well-explained. 
   - The point about understanding the historical context of literature containing racial slurs is pertinent. However, you might want to acknowledge the ongoing debate about how these materials should be handled in contemporary settings to show a balanced perspective.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Your conclusion effectively summarizes your stance. It reaffirms your belief in the current system while acknowledging the necessity for some level of censorship for extremely harmful materials.

6. **Technical Aspects**:
   - Ensure all names and references are correctly and fully cited if applicable. Avoid using placeholders like ""@PERSON3"" and ""@PERSON2.""

**Revised Excerpt for Improvement**:
""Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated. For instance, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee contains racial slurs, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were, unfortunately, a reflection of the era's societal norms. Someone cannot be frustrated with a novel written decades ago because it has something offensive in it by today's standards.""

Overall, you have presented a thoughtful and reasoned essay. Focus on improving your spelling and grammar, using specific examples, and considering the balance between different viewpoints to strengthen your argument further.

Keep up the good work!",0.9081691854983928,0.8870813928739174
8,25,"The essay in question struggles significantly in several areas and requires considerable improvement. The clarity of the thesis statement is lacking, which makes it difficult for the reader to grasp the main argument. The content is minimal and fails to address the prompt adequately, as it does not provide enough supporting evidence or detailed anecdotes from the memoir to make a compelling case. The structure is disjointed, with abrupt transitions between ideas that disrupt the flow and make the essay difficult to follow. Furthermore, the language used is simplistic and does not convey the emotional depth that the essay seems to aim for. There are numerous grammatical errors and issues with spelling and punctuation that further detract from the overall readability. In summary, the essay needs to focus on presenting a clear thesis, supported by specific examples and personal anecdotes, while improving both the organization and the expressiveness of the language used.",25,"Thank you for sharing your essay with me. Your effort in addressing how the setting affects the cyclist in Joe Kurmaskie's ""Rough Road Ahead"" is appreciated. Let's delve deeper into both the strengths of your piece and where we can enhance emotional expressiveness and clarity.

**Strengths:**
1. **Content Understanding:** You've chosen relevant aspects of the setting (the desert, ghost town, water pump) that significantly impact the cyclist's experience. This shows you have a good grasp of the story's main events.
2. **Prompt Adherence:** Your response stays on topic and connects the setting with the cyclist's emotions and decisions, which is key to addressing the prompt.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Emotional Depth and Expressiveness:** To create a stronger emotional connection, try to include more vivid descriptions and personal reflections from the cyclist's perspective. For example, instead of just stating that ""his hope was dwindling,"" delve into the emotions he might have felt: ""With each passing mile, the oppressive heat and barren landscape seemed to sap not just his strength, but his very will to continue, leaving him feeling utterly defeated and alone.""

2. **Clarity and Flow:** Your sentences often contain multiple ideas that could be separated for better clarity. For instance, rewriting ""He found a water pump that produced a tar like substance as a result the desert and the lack of water made him wish he was dead"" into more distinct sentences would help: ""He found a water pump, but it only produced a tar-like substance. The harsh conditions of the desert and his lack of water made him feel desperate, even wishing for death.""

3. **Grammatical Accuracy:** Pay attention to grammar and spelling to ensure your essay reads smoothly. For instance:
   - ""rough raod"" should be ""Rough Road""
   - ""he water supply was emicated"" should be ""his water supply was depleted""
   - ""he decided never to take advice from strangers and to trust his map"" can be more nuanced by saying, ""he vowed never to trust strangers' advice again and to always rely on his own map.""

4. **Detailed Descriptions:** Adding more specific examples and sensory details can enhance the narrative's impact. Describe the oppressive heat, the parched landscape, and the cyclist's physical and emotional state in more detail: ""The relentless sun beat down on him, causing wide rings of dried sweat to form on his shirt. Each pedal stroke felt heavier, his mouth parched, and his vision blurred with mirages.""

**Suggestions:**
- **Vivid Anecdotes:** Include more detailed anecdotes from the text. For instance, describe the moment he stumbled upon Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp and the relief he felt when he finally found water.
- **Expressive Language:** Use more varied and emotive vocabulary to convey the cyclist's despair and eventual relief. Words like ""oppressive,"" ""desolate,"" ""agonizing,"" and","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The setting desented in the story, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summers day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the setting and its effect on the cyclist but lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The inclusion of specific examples, such as the intense heat and dehydration the cyclist experienced, provides some support to the points made. However, the response often strays from a clear focus on the emotional and physical impact of the setting on the cyclist. The language used is somewhat repetitive and lacks variety, making the reading experience less engaging. Additionally, there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as ""desented"" instead of ""deserted"" and ""sorroundings"" instead of ""surroundings,"" which detract from the overall readability. While the narrative does include some transitional phrases, the flow is disjointed, and the essay fails to maintain a strong emotional connection with the reader. Further development of the central idea and emotional resonance would improve the essay significantly.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the setting and its effect on the cyclist but lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The inclusion of specific examples, such as the intense heat and dehydration the cyclist experienced, provides some support to the points made. However, the response often strays from a clear focus on the emotional and physical impact of the setting on the cyclist.

While the narrative does include some transitional phrases, the flow is disjointed, and the essay fails to maintain a strong emotional connection with the reader. Further development of the central idea and emotional resonance would improve the essay significantly.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator is ready. The narrator tried the test once and failed. She bought herself a flower to cheer herself up. Her mother talked to her and then she felt better. She felt determined to pass the driving test just like the flower was determined to survive.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic recounting of the narrator's journey with the driving test and includes some emotional elements, such as the narrator's initial failure and their interaction with their mother. However, it falls short in terms of depth and emotional resonance. The essay lacks specific personal anecdotes and vivid emotional appeals that would make the narrative more engaging and impactful. The connection between the flower and the narrator's determination is not fully fleshed out, leaving the reader wanting more insight into the narrator's feelings and motivations. Additionally, the structure of the essay is quite simplistic, with a series of events listed without much coherence or fluid transitions, which detracts from the overall flow. The language used is basic and does not capture the emotional intensity or expressiveness expected in a high-scoring essay. While there are minimal grammatical errors, the vocabulary is limited and repetitive, which affects the overall readability and engagement. To improve, the essay should include more detailed personal stories, stronger emotional appeals, and varied, expressive language to create a more compelling narrative.

DOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit 
by Joe Kurmaskie 
FORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece 
of advice for the solo cyclist would be, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers 
who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” It’s not that a group of 
old guys doesn’t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid 
place. Things change. 
At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer 
evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn’t have done was 
let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice 
and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to 
Yosemite National Park. 
They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I 
would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with 
strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town.” 
This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time—say, before the last world war—but 
on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water 
supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool 
pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. 
Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, 
and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had 
been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of 
California in June. 
I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my 
strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the 
neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water 
wouldn’t cool down. It didn’t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. 
The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make 
that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so—a test of my inner spirit. 
Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was 
replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign 
jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. 
The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so 
cruel. 
I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it 
really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased 
past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. 
The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my 
shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June 
simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, 
caused me to laugh. 
It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. 
There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride 
down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d 
be fine. 
Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make 
sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst 
of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. 
In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building—abandoned years 
earlier, by the looks of it—had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A 
sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still 
be seen. 
I hung my head. 
That smoky blues tune “Summertime” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating 
brain. 
I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. 
I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you 
have left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. 
It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some 
expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and 
their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I 
was going to lose consciousness for the last time. 
Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining 
elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear 
were all behind me. 
GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP—IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE 
YOUR BEST BET! 
“And the only bet,” I remember thinking. 
As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an 
overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait—any bait, even 
though I didn’t own a rod or reel. 
An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from 
my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. 
“Where you headed in such a hurry?” 
“Yosemite,” I whispered. 
“Know the best way to get there?” 
I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group 
I’d listened to in Lodi. 
“Yes, sir! I own a very good map.” 
And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.

FEEDBACK: 
","FEEDBACK:

Thank you for your effort on this essay. It's clear that you have grasped the main events of ""Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie and how the setting impacts the cyclist. Here are some points to help you improve:

1. **Clarity and Detail:**
   - Your essay touches on important aspects of the setting, but it could benefit from more specific details. For example, you mention that the cyclist's water supply was ""emicated,"" but it's unclear what you mean. Perhaps you meant ""diminished"" or ""depleted."" Providing clear and precise language will help your reader better understand your points.

2. **Structure and Flow:**
   - Your essay would be stronger with a clearer structure. Start with an introduction that outlines what you will discuss. The body of the essay should then provide detailed evidence and examples from the text to support your points, and conclude with a summary. Each paragraph should have a clear main idea and support it with details.

3. **Grammar and Spelling:**
   - There are some grammatical and spelling errors that need attention. For example:
     - ""In rough raod ahead"" should be ""In 'Rough Road Ahead.'""
     - ""he water supply was emicated"" should be ""his water supply was depleted.""
     - ""He found a water pump that produced a tar like substance as a result the desert and the lack of water made him wish he was dead"" can be split into two sentences for clarity: ""He found a water pump that produced a tar-like substance. As a result, the desert and the lack of water made him wish he was dead.""

4. **Connection to the Theme:**
   - You mention how the setting affected the cyclist, but it would be beneficial to connect this more deeply to the broader themes of the story. How does the setting shape his character or influence the story's message?

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Your concluding sentence, ""That is how the feature affected the setting,"" needs to be rephrased. Instead, consider summing up how the setting influenced the cyclist's experience and the overall narrative.

Here's a revised example to guide you:

""In 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaskie, the harsh desert setting significantly affects the cyclist's journey. Traveling through the desert of California in June, his water supply quickly depletes. This scarcity of water leads him to a ghost town, where he finds a water pump that only produces a tar-like substance. These challenges cause his hope to dwindle, making him doubt the advice he received from strangers and vow to rely solely on his map in the future. The unforgiving desert setting tests his limits and shapes his resolve, illustrating the profound impact of the environment on his journey.""

Keep working on these areas, and you'll see improvement in your writing. Great effort, and I look forward to seeing your next draft!",0.83528599679661,0.8479517721610377
9,26,"Your essay demonstrates a basic understanding of how the setting impacts the cyclist, but it could benefit from more specific and vivid details to enhance both clarity and emotional resonance. The lack of personal anecdotes and emotional appeals makes it difficult to connect with the reader on an emotional level. The structure is present but not fully developed, leading to a somewhat disjointed flow of ideas. Transitions between sentences and paragraphs could be smoother to ensure a more coherent narrative. Additionally, the language used is fairly simple and repetitive, which detracts from the overall expressiveness of the essay. More varied and emotive vocabulary would help in making the piece more engaging. Finally, while the conventions are mostly adhered to, there are minor grammatical and punctuation errors that need correction to enhance readability. Overall, focusing on adding emotionally rich content, improving narrative flow, and diversifying language will significantly improve the essay.",26,"Thank you for your effort in identifying how the setting impacted the cyclist in Joe Kurmaskie's narrative. Your essay touches on some crucial elements such as the heat of the desert, the abandoned towns, and the cyclist's limited water supply. These are excellent starting points that can be further expanded to create a more vivid and emotionally resonant narrative.

To enhance the emotional connection and impact of your writing, consider delving deeper into the cyclist’s experiences and emotions. For instance, instead of simply stating, ""The month was June a hot month and the sun was beating down on him,"" you could describe the physical and emotional toll the heat took on him. How did the relentless sun make him feel? Did it evoke a sense of desperation, frustration, or perhaps even a moment of hopelessness? Adding such reflections can help the reader connect more deeply with the cyclist's ordeal.

Your essay would also benefit from more varied sentence structures and emotive vocabulary. For example, instead of ""he was riding in the desert,"" you could say, ""he pedaled through the unforgiving desert, each mile feeling like an endless test of endurance."" This paints a more vivid picture and conveys the emotional weight of his journey.

Additionally, consider providing more specific examples from the text to support your points. When you mention the abandoned towns, you could include details about the ghostly remnants of civilization the cyclist encountered, such as the rusted pumps and the eerie silence that amplified his isolation and vulnerability. These details not only support your analysis but also enrich the narrative.

In terms of organization, ensure your essay flows smoothly by using transitional phrases to connect your thoughts. For example, you might say, ""As the sun reached its zenith, the cyclist's struggle intensified, battling not only the scorching heat but also the psychological impact of seeing one abandoned town after another.""

Finally, pay close attention to grammatical accuracy and eliminate repetitive language. This will improve the readability and overall impact of your essay.

Overall, your essay has a solid foundation. By incorporating more emotional depth, varied language, and detailed examples, you can create a more compelling and impactful narrative that resonates with your readers. Keep exploring the emotional nuances of your subjects, and you'll continue to grow as a writer. Great job so far, and I look forward to seeing your revisions!","

Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The setting desented in the story, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summers day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the setting and its effect on the cyclist but lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The inclusion of specific examples, such as the intense heat and dehydration the cyclist experienced, provides some support to the points made. However, the response often strays from a clear focus on the emotional and physical impact of the setting on the cyclist. The language used is somewhat repetitive and lacks variety, making the reading experience less engaging. Additionally, there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as ""desented"" instead of ""deserted"" and ""sorroundings"" instead of ""surroundings,"" which detract from the overall readability. While the narrative does include some transitional phrases, the flow is disjointed, and the essay fails to maintain a strong emotional connection with the reader. Further development of the central idea and emotional resonance would improve the essay significantly.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay delves into the emotional and cultural elements of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, effectively highlighting the significance of Cuban culture and familial bonds. However, the clarity of your thesis statement could be enhanced to better convey the emotional impact and central theme of your analysis. While you include some personal stories and quotes from the memoir, the arguments would benefit from more in-depth development and additional supporting evidence to make a stronger emotional appeal. The organizational structure is somewhat present, but the transitions between paragraphs need to be smoother to ensure a logical flow that enhances the emotional impact. In terms of language and style, your essay shows some variety in vocabulary and sentence structures, but there are areas where word choice and expressiveness could be improved to better capture the emotional nuances of the memoir. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall readability and impact of your writing. To improve, focus on creating a more emotionally resonant thesis, developing your arguments with richer anecdotes and emotional appeals, and refining your language for greater expressiveness and grammatical accuracy.

DOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit 
by Joe Kurmaskie 
FORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece 
of advice for the solo cyclist would be, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers 
who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” It’s not that a group of 
old guys doesn’t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid 
place. Things change. 
At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer 
evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn’t have done was 
let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice 
and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to 
Yosemite National Park. 
They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I 
would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with 
strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town.” 
This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time—say, before the last world war—but 
on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water 
supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool 
pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. 
Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, 
and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had 
been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of 
California in June. 
I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my 
strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the 
neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water 
wouldn’t cool down. It didn’t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. 
The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make 
that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so—a test of my inner spirit. 
Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was 
replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign 
jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. 
The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so 
cruel. 
I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it 
really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased 
past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. 
The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my 
shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June 
simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, 
caused me to laugh. 
It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. 
There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride 
down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d 
be fine. 
Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make 
sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst 
of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. 
In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building—abandoned years 
earlier, by the looks of it—had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A 
sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still 
be seen. 
I hung my head. 
That smoky blues tune “Summertime” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating 
brain. 
I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. 
I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you 
have left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. 
It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some 
expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and 
their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I 
was going to lose consciousness for the last time. 
Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining 
elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear 
were all behind me. 
GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP—IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE 
YOUR BEST BET! 
“And the only bet,” I remember thinking. 
As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an 
overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait—any bait, even 
though I didn’t own a rod or reel. 
An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from 
my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. 
“Where you headed in such a hurry?” 
“Yosemite,” I whispered. 
“Know the best way to get there?” 
I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group 
I’d listened to in Lodi. 
“Yes, sir! I own a very good map.” 
And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he was riding in the desert and all the towns he was going to were abandoned. The month was June a hot month and the sun was beating down on him. And he was cycling with very little water.  
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","FEEDBACK:

Your essay has a clear focus on how the setting affected the cyclist, which is a great start! Here are some areas to improve to make your writing more engaging and detailed:

1. **Expand Your Ideas**: You've mentioned several key points about the setting, but they could be expanded further. Describe the desert in more detail—what does it look like, how does it make the cyclist feel? What do the abandoned towns look like, and how do they contribute to the atmosphere?

2. **Sentence Variety**: Try to vary your sentence structure to make the essay more interesting to read. Instead of starting each sentence the same way, mix it up with different sentence lengths and styles.

3. **Show, Don’t Just Tell**: Instead of just stating the facts, you can show the reader what the cyclist is experiencing. For example, instead of saying, ""The month was June, a hot month and the sun was beating down on him,"" you could write, ""In the scorching June heat, the relentless sun beat down on him, causing sweat to pour off his brow.""

4. **Details and Sensory Language**: Use sensory details to help the reader visualize and feel what the cyclist is going through. Describe the heat, the dryness, the fatigue, and any emotions the cyclist might be experiencing.

5. **Grammar and Punctuation**: Pay attention to grammar and punctuation to make your writing clear and professional. For example, ""For example, he was riding in the desert"" needs a comma after ""example,"" and ""And he was cycling with very little water"" could be revised to flow better with the previous sentence.

Here's an example of how you might revise one of your sentences with these tips in mind:

Original: ""The month was June a hot month and the sun was beating down on him.""
Revised: ""In the intense heat of June, the sun relentlessly beat down on him, each ray feeling like a flame against his skin.""

Keep up the good work and continue to develop your skills! Your attention to how the setting impacts the character is a strong foundation.",0.9310731857823241,0.9131578235884443
10,38,"The essay presents a clear and focused argument on why books should not be removed from library shelves based on individual opinions, which holds the reader's attention. However, it could benefit from better organization and clearer transitions between ideas. The essay's structure is somewhat fragmented, making it challenging to follow the writer's train of thought at times. The word choice is generally effective but lacks precision and variety in certain areas, which can detract from the overall impact. The fluency of the sentences is good, with a noticeable rhythm, although occasional awkward constructions slow down the readability. Finally, the essay demonstrates limited control of standard writing conventions, with frequent errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which impede readability. Overall, the essay offers a strong viewpoint but needs refinement in organization, word choice, and grammatical accuracy to enhance its effectiveness.",38,"Thank you for your effort in addressing the topic of censorship in libraries. Your main idea is clear, and you have made a good start by incorporating a quote from Katherine Paterson, which strengthens your argument. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall impact.

1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis statement could be more precise and assertive. Instead of asking questions in the opening sentences, try to clearly state your position and what you intend to argue. For example, ""Books should not be removed from public libraries solely based on individual opinions, as this would limit the diversity of ideas and perspectives available to readers.""

2. **Organization**: While you have included relevant examples, the organization of your essay needs improvement. Your paragraphs should be structured to support your thesis more effectively. Ensure each paragraph transitions smoothly to the next. For instance, your anecdote about asking friends about books could be better integrated into a paragraph that discusses the subjective nature of opinions.

3. **Word Choice**: There are several instances where word choice could be improved for clarity and professionalism. For example, ""bookselfs"" should be ""bookshelves,"" ""self"" should be ""shelf,"" and ""arthur"" should be ""author."" Additionally, phrases like ""specific personality"" could be rephrased for clarity—perhaps to ""individual preferences.""

4. **Sentence Fluency**: Some sentences are awkwardly constructed and could benefit from revision for better flow. For example, ""Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good"" could be rewritten as ""After reading a few pages myself, I found it quite enjoyable."" Ensure that your sentences vary in structure and length to maintain the reader's interest.

5. **Grammar and Conventions**: There are several grammatical errors, including issues with punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. For instance, ""corious"" should be ""curious,"" ""varity"" should be ""variety,"" and ""self"" should be ""shelf."" Also, ensure that quotes are correctly attributed and punctuated.

6. **Supporting Details**: While you provide some examples, your arguments would benefit from more supporting details and examples to make them more compelling. Consider including specific instances where censorship has led to a loss of important information or diverse viewpoints.

7. **Concluding Sentence**: Your concluding paragraph should effectively summarize your main points and reinforce your thesis. Currently, it ends abruptly. Consider crafting a conclusion that restates your position and emphasizes the importance of maintaining a diverse collection of books in libraries.

8. **Quote Integration**: Integrate the Katherine Paterson quote more seamlessly into your argument. Explain its relevance and how it supports your position.

Here’s a revised version of your introduction and first paragraph to illustrate these suggestions:

""Books should not be removed from public libraries solely based on individual opinions, as this would limit","

When interacting with students, I emphasize the importance of clear communication and encourage them to ask questions whenever they encounter difficulties.

My feedback is thorough and aimed at helping students refine their writing skills, ensuring they grasp the nuances of grammar, syntax, and proper usage. I also make it a point to praise correct usage and well-structured arguments, reinforcing positive learning experiences. When reviewing student work, I assess the clarity of their thesis statements, the coherence and relevance of their supporting details, and the precision of their language. Essays that exhibit weak organization, fragmented sentences, or insufficient content development receive specific guidance on how to improve these areas.

I focus not only on identifying errors but also on providing concrete suggestions for enhancement, such as refining vocabulary or restructuring paragraphs for better flow. For strong essays, I commend the logical flow, varied word choice, and adherence to writing conventions, noting how these elements contribute to the overall effectiveness of the piece.

In summary, my teaching approach is methodical and supportive, aiming to enhance students' mastery of the English language through consistent and precise feedback, clear instructions, and an open channel for questions and discussions. By maintaining high standards and providing constructive and specific feedback, I strive to help students become confident and skilled writers.

Additionally, there are several grammatical errors, including issues with sentence structure, spelling, and punctuation, which detract from the readability and overall impact of the essay. To enhance clarity and effectiveness, ensure that each sentence is grammatically correct and that transitions between paragraphs are smooth. Lastly, refining your vocabulary and sentence structures will help to articulate your arguments more convincingly and maintain the reader's interest throughout.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: for something like school work.     Lets say the libraries remove a human trafficking book from the libraries becuase people find it offensive. Then a local school has a praject on human trafficking. The students go to the libraries to get some books on it. Now do to somebody elses dislike of the books these kids don't get to use those books to do thier reshearch.     It wouldn't be fair to everyone to remove objects from the libraries just cause some other people find it offensive. The

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay you have written addresses the topic of censorship in libraries and argues that books, movies, magazines, and other materials should not be removed simply because they are found offensive by some individuals. Your main idea is clear, but the essay lacks sufficient supporting details and examples, which makes the argument less compelling. The organization of your essay could be improved, as it transitions abruptly between ideas and lacks a clear, logical flow. For instance, the paragraphs could be better structured to support your thesis effectively. The word choice is often imprecise and informal, such as ""ext."" instead of ""etc."" and ""do to"" instead of ""due to."" Additionally, there are several grammatical errors, including issues with sentence structure, spelling, and punctuation, which detract from the readability and overall impact of the essay. To enhance clarity and effectiveness, ensure that each sentence is grammatically correct and that transitions between paragraphs are smooth. Lastly, refining your vocabulary and sentence structures will help to articulate your arguments more convincingly and maintain the reader's interest throughout.

Censorship in the Libraries 
""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken
off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then
you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books
left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, Author

a natural sound; the reader can move easily through the piece, although it may
lack a certain rhythm and grace. 
•
some repeated patterns of sentence structure, length, and beginnings that may
detract somewhat from overall impact. 
•
strong control over simple sentence structures, but variable control over more
complex sentences; fragments, if present, are usually effective. 
•
occasional lapses in stylistic control; dialogue, if used, sounds natural for the
most part, but may at times sound stilted or unnatural. 
Score
3:
The
writing tends to be mechanical rather than fluid. Occasional awkward
constructions may force the reader to slow down or reread. The writing is characterized by 
•
some passages that invite fluid oral reading; however, others do not. 
•
some variety in sentence structure, length, and beginnings, although the writer
falls into repetitive sentence patterns.

good control over simple sentence structures, but little control over more complex
sentences; fragments, if present, may not be effective. 
•
sentences which, although functional, lack energy. 
•
lapses in stylistic control; dialogue, if used, may sound stilted or unnatural. 
•
text that is too short to demonstrate variety and control.

errors in grammar and usage that interfere with readability and meaning. 
•
substantial need for editing. 
Score 1: Numerous errors in usage, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation repeatedly distract
the reader and make the text difficult to read. In fact, the severity and frequency of errors are so
overwhelming that the reader finds it difficult to focus on the message and must reread for
meaning. The writing is characterized by 
7 
•
very limited skill in using conventions. 
•
basic punctuation (including end-of-sentence punctuation) that tends to be
omitted, haphazard, or incorrect. 
•
frequent spelling errors that significantly impair readability. 
•
capitalization that appears to be random. 
•
a need for extensive editing. 
In case of doubts 
Since some of the ratings may be close, award the LOWER grade in case there is not enough
information, i.e. that there are too few sentences / words.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Do you think that certain materials should be removed off library's bookselfs if someone dislikes or does not agree with the topic or the plot? Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion about what the book is convincing readers?     I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self. But if I have the right to remove that book from the self- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the self for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from the arthur, Katherine Paterson, from my opinion, I believe that what she is saying is very true. Considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things, if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the self, there would not be a varity of books for people to choose from. I have sometimes gotten corious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book. They either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible. Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good. So if they had the right to remove that book I would have never got the chance to read that book.     I do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelfs just on their specific personality. Everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books. Everyone should get a large variety
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay on the important topic of book removal and censorship in public libraries. Here are some constructive points for you to consider:

1. **Clarify Your Argument**:
   - Your main argument is clear, but try to strengthen it by clearly stating your thesis in the introduction. For example, ""I believe that no book should be banned from public libraries simply because someone dislikes or disagrees with its content.""

2. **Quote and Attribution**:
   - You included a quote from Katherine Paterson, which adds value to your argument. However, ensure that quotes are accurate and properly attributed. Also, use quotation marks and provide context. The quote could be revised and formatted like this: 
     - ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf—that work I abhor—then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the shelf for any of us."" — Katherine Paterson.

3. **Spelling and Grammar**:
   - Pay attention to spelling and grammar to improve readability:
     - ""off library's bookselfs"" should be ""off the library's bookshelves.""
     - ""self"" should be ""shelf.""
     - ""arthur"" should be ""author.""
     - ""varity"" should be ""variety.""
     - ""corious"" should be ""curious.""
     - ""shelfs"" should be ""shelves.""
     - ""specific personality"" should be ""personal opinion.""

4. **Structure and Flow**:
   - Organize your essay into clear paragraphs with topic sentences. This will help guide the reader through your points. For example:
     - **Introduction**: State your thesis and outline your main points.
     - **Body Paragraphs**: Develop each point in a separate paragraph. Use evidence, examples, and quotes to support your arguments.
     - **Conclusion**: Summarize your points and restate your thesis in a compelling way.

5. **Develop Your Ideas**:
   - Expand on your examples to make your points more persuasive. For instance, when you mention asking a friend about a book, elaborate on how differing opinions illustrate the diversity of perspectives.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Your conclusion should wrap up your argument and reinforce your main points. For example: ""In conclusion, allowing individual preferences to dictate the removal of books from public libraries undermines the diversity of thought and freedom of access to information. Everyone should have the opportunity to explore a wide range of books, even those that some may find offensive or disagreeable.""

Overall, you have a strong foundation for your essay. By refining your language, structuring your argument more clearly, and expanding on your ideas, you can create a more compelling and polished piece. Keep up the good work",0.8986424316057682,0.8924690722685318
11,39,"The essay presents a general stance on the importance of preserving freedom of speech and argues against the removal of potentially offensive materials from shelves. However, the thesis is not clearly articulated, and the arguments lack coherent development and sufficient supporting details. The organization of the essay is weak, with ideas not flowing logically from one to the next and transitions between paragraphs and sentences being unclear or absent. Additionally, the word choice is simplistic and often imprecise, which detracts from the intended message. Sentence structures are repetitive and awkward, making the essay difficult to read and understand. There are numerous grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which impede readability and distract from the overall argument. Strengthening the clarity of the thesis, organizing the content more logically, varying sentence structures, and enhancing grammatical accuracy would significantly improve the essay.",39,"**Teacher Feedback:**

Your essay presents a clear stance on the importance of freedom of speech and the role of rating systems over outright censorship. However, several issues need addressing to enhance the overall effectiveness and clarity of your argument.

1. **Thesis Clarity and Development:**
   - Your argument is somewhat scattered and lacks a well-defined thesis. A clear thesis statement at the beginning will help you present a focused and compelling argument.
   - Consider rephrasing your thesis to something like: ""Instead of removing offensive materials from shelves, we should implement a rating system to protect freedom of speech while ensuring content is appropriately accessed.""

2. **Grammar and Language Conventions:**
   - There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the essay that hinder readability. For instance, ""thing should come with a rateing"" should be ""things should come with a rating.""
   - Ensure subject-verb agreement and proper tense usage. For example, ""To many people have faught"" should be ""Too many people have fought.""
   - Pay attention to spelling and punctuation. Words like ""speech,"" ""violence,"" ""profane,"" ""rating,"" ""inappropriate,"" and ""monitor"" are misspelled and need correction.
   - Capitalization errors are frequent. For instance, ""freedom of speach"" should be ""freedom of speech,"" and ""I strongly belive that;That saying"" should be ""I strongly believe that; that saying.""

3. **Sentence Structure and Fluency:**
   - Sentence structures are often fragmented and lack fluidity. For example, ""That's like saying they should have taken @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 when it first came out off the market"" is unclear and needs rephrasing for clarity.
   - Try to vary your sentence lengths and structures to enhance the flow of your writing.

4. **Organization:**
   - The essay lacks a clear organizational structure. Ensure each paragraph has a clear topic sentence and that your ideas flow logically from one to the next.
   - Group related ideas together. Separate your arguments about books, music, and other media into distinct paragraphs with appropriate transitions.

5. **Support and Development:**
   - Your arguments need more specific, relevant examples and supporting details. For instance, when discussing the role of parents in monitoring content, provide more concrete examples or statistical data if possible.
   - Avoid overly general statements and strive for depth in your argumentation.

6. **Word Choice:**
   - There are several instances of imprecise or incorrect word usage. For example, ""inapprotive"" should be ""inappropriate.""
   - Use more precise and varied vocabulary to enhance the persuasiveness of your argument.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- **Rewrite the Introduction:** Clearly state your thesis and briefly outline your main points.
- **Enhance Grammar and Conventions:** Proofread your work for grammatical errors, focusing on spelling, punctuation, and capitalization.","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: doing drugs, and other various risky activities are okay? I know I sure wouldn't.     Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society. It can be found nearly anywhere. In books, magazines, @CAPS1 shows, movies, on the @CAPS2, you name it. All of these are easily accessible by children of all ages. That is why there should be censorship of certain materials, to a certain degree. By this, I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library, it should only be able to be

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay provides a compelling argument for the necessity of censorship to protect children from inappropriate content. The thesis is clear and grammatically correct, establishing a strong foundation for your viewpoint. The development of your argument is consistent, using grammatically precise sentences to emphasize the dangers of exposing young children to explicit material. The conclusion effectively reinforces the thesis, summarizing the key points made throughout the essay. The organization of the essay is commendable, with each paragraph logically flowing into the next, guided by clear and grammatically correct transitions and topic sentences. Your word choice is varied and appropriate, enhancing the persuasiveness of your argument. The complexity and correctness of your sentence structures further contribute to the overall readability and impact of the essay. Additionally, the essay demonstrates strong control of standard writing conventions, with minimal errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Overall, your writing is clear, focused, and engaging, adhering to grammatical conventions and displaying a logical and effective organization.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Have you ever watched or seen a book or even a movie that you do not think kids should be reading or watching? I have, heard of many books. There are even music out there that only adults should be listening too. There are some parents that are strick on what their kids watch, hear, read or sing. I know for a fact that my parents would not want me to be letting my childern read, watch or hear that kind of stuff.      When you think of the music, books, or movies that need to be out of childern

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents an understandable perspective on the importance of shielding children from inappropriate content in books, movies, and music. However, it suffers from several issues that impact its overall effectiveness. The clarity of the thesis could be improved, as it feels somewhat scattered and not grammatically polished. The arguments in support of the main idea are present but are overly simplistic and repetitive, lacking the depth and precise language needed to fully engage the reader. Additionally, the organization of the essay is quite weak, with paragraphs that do not follow a clear, logical structure and transitions that are often awkward or missing altogether. The word choice and sentence structures are basic and exhibit numerous grammatical errors, including spelling mistakes (""childern,"" ""apporaite,"" ""differnet"") and incorrect usage of words. These issues detract from the readability and overall impact of the essay. Furthermore, the conclusion, while summarizing the main points, does not effectively synthesize the arguments to leave a lasting impression. Overall, while the essay's intent is clear, it requires significant refinement in clarity, grammatical accuracy, organization, and language use to meet the stated prioritization of grammatical precision and effective communication.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: kind of stuff.      When you think of the music, books, or movies that need to be out of childern reach what should they be? I think the movies, books and even music that have bad language, violence, and bullying need to be hidden from childern. Bad language is not apporaite from kids to be hearing when they are under the age of ten or even older. When you hear a bad song coming on when you have little kids near you, you should turn the station to a differnet station. If little kids hear this

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents an understandable perspective on the importance of shielding children from inappropriate content in books, movies, and music. However, it suffers from several issues that impact its overall effectiveness. The clarity of the thesis could be improved, as it feels somewhat scattered and not grammatically polished. The arguments in support of the main idea are present but are overly simplistic and repetitive, lacking the depth and precise language needed to fully engage the reader. Additionally, the organization of the essay is quite weak, with paragraphs that do not follow a clear, logical structure and transitions that are often awkward or missing altogether. The word choice and sentence structures are basic and exhibit numerous grammatical errors, including spelling mistakes (""childern,"" ""apporaite,"" ""differnet"") and incorrect usage of words. These issues detract from the readability and overall impact of the essay. Furthermore, the conclusion, while summarizing the main points, does not effectively synthesize the arguments to leave a lasting impression. Overall, while the essay's intent is clear, it requires significant refinement in clarity, grammatical accuracy, organization, and language use to meet the stated prioritization of grammatical precision and effective communication.

Censorship in the Libraries 
""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken
off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then
you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books
left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, Author 
Write a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting your views on censorship in libraries.
Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,
should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Support your position

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I do not feel these types of things should not be taken off the shelves.What i think is that thing should come with a rateing because  this is a free country and for some one to do something like that it would be takeing away someone's freedom of speach.To many people have faught in the past for just simply freedom of speach.I think that if people rate the  thing's  that come out then they will not go in to the wrong hands. That's like saying they should have taken @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 when it first came out off the market because it has violance in it ,profange language,and guns that company will had lost a lot of money because it is inapprotive for kids.I think that parent's shouldn't go buy a @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old something like that but some parents do .It not the creaters fault of the actions of how people react to what ever is put out there because the buyers have to be more responseable and make sure that what ever it is is supervised and carefully montoired. There's an old saying ' every thing isn't made for every body' .I strongly belive that;That saying is so true .Every body don't like the same thing that some one eles likes but its okay for that person but it's not okay for you because as they say everything isn't for every body and you can't fource nothing on some one.Well every thing isn't approtive  for every one we all have are limites to every thing and if you watch what kids watch and do than things want be so inapprotive for this wold . Certion books young children should not read because they have sex in them and they talk about things that a child should not even be thinking about at that age.When children read books like that they tend to think about sex and how what they read about will feel but children should not be thinking about that type of stuff that why its there parent's responseabitly to montoir what there children read because that there job as parent's to do not the person who wrote the book because they @MONTH1 think there writing to a much older group that can relate to what there talking about but then again there just speacking there mind and infourceing there freedom of speach right one of the rights that we as a people together have been fighting for .I also feel that music help's us to express are selfs so if someone feels that the music is inapprotive for there child then they need to watch what there child is listen to.Music brings out the different moods in every body.All magazines are not for every one because as we all know there are adult magazines the produce certion imagary that children should not see but you can not blame the creater only the buyer is in fault for leaving it in the wrong place after there done with it .There just people trying to make money  off things that they know that people like.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for your essay. I appreciate the effort you put into expressing your opinions clearly. Here are some areas where you can improve your writing:

1. **Clarity and Structure**: Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Try to organize your thoughts into distinct paragraphs, each covering a specific point. This will make your argument easier to follow.

2. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are several grammatical errors and typos in your essay. For example, ""rateing"" should be ""rating,"" ""violance"" should be ""violence,"" and ""responseable"" should be ""responsible."" Using a spell checker or grammar tool can help catch these errors.

3. **Consistency and Tone**: Ensure that you maintain a consistent tone throughout your essay. Avoid using informal language like ""wanna"" or symbols like ""@"" for censoring words.

4. **Support Your Arguments**: While you present several opinions, they would be more persuasive if supported by examples or evidence. For instance, when you argue that certain books should not be for children, you could reference specific examples or studies.

5. **Sentence Structure**: Work on varying your sentence structure to enhance readability. Avoid overly long sentences, as they can be difficult to follow. For example, break down complex thoughts into shorter, clearer sentences.

6. **Punctuation and Capitalization**: Ensure correct use of punctuation and capitalization. For example, ""i"" should be ""I,"" and ""faught"" should be ""fought."" Proper punctuation will make your writing more professional and easier to read.

7. **Argument Development**: Make sure each paragraph transitions smoothly to the next. For example, when discussing freedom of speech, explain how it connects to your views on ratings and censorship more clearly.

8. **Relevance and Focus**: Stay focused on the main topic. Some parts of your essay wander off-topic, which can dilute your argument. Stick closely to your main points related to freedom of speech, censorship, and the responsibilities of creators and consumers.

Here’s a revised version of your initial statement for clarity:

""I do not believe that certain items should be removed from shelves. Instead, I think they should come with ratings. This is a free country, and removing such items would infringe on freedom of speech. Many have fought for this right. If items are properly rated, they are less likely to fall into the wrong hands.""

By concentrating on these areas, your writing will become clearer, more persuasive, and more engaging. Keep practicing, and you'll continue to improve!",0.9158534842141592,0.9049445987907296
12,42,"The essay effectively attempts to address the prompt, detailing how the setting impacts the cyclist in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" However, the response falls short in several areas. The content touches on some significant points but lacks depth and specificity in its supporting evidence. The thesis, while present, is not articulated clearly, making it harder for the reader to grasp the writer's main argument from the onset. Additionally, the response occasionally strays off-topic, and some points are underdeveloped. The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the text but doesn't fully engage with it. Language use is somewhat limited, with noticeable grammatical errors and a lack of varied vocabulary, which detracts from the overall quality of the writing. The organization of the essay is basic, and while there are attempts at transitions, they are not consistently effective, resulting in a disjointed narrative flow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing more detailed and specific evidence from the text, ensuring clear and cohesive argumentation, and enhancing grammatical accuracy and vocabulary range.",42,"The essay on how the setting affects the cyclist in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" demonstrates a basic understanding of the narrative but requires significant improvement in clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy.

1. **Thesis Statement and Introduction:**
   - The thesis statement is present but could be more precisely articulated. For example, ""The setting in 'Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit' significantly impacts the cyclist, primarily through its varied and challenging terrains."" This would provide a clearer focus for the essay.

2. **Content and Development:**
   - The essay correctly identifies key aspects of the setting that affect the cyclist, such as the abandoned towns, rolling hills, and extreme heat. However, the analysis lacks depth. Specific examples from the text should be integrated more thoroughly to support your points. For instance, discuss how the cyclist's encounter with the ""tarlike substance"" from the water pump intensifies his struggle.
   
3. **Organization and Coherence:**
   - The organization needs improvement to enhance logical flow. Each paragraph should start with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea. For example, ""The cyclist's journey begins optimistically but quickly deteriorates as he encounters the harsh realities of the abandoned towns."" 
   - Ensure smooth transitions between ideas to maintain coherence. Phrases like ""Additionally,"" ""Furthermore,"" and ""In contrast"" can help link your arguments logically.

4. **Language and Vocabulary:**
   - The language used is fairly simple and repetitive. Try to incorporate a more varied vocabulary to enhance the essay's sophistication. For example, instead of ""totally abandoned,"" you might say ""completely desolate.""
   - Attention to grammatical accuracy is crucial. For instance, ""his working"" should be ""he is working,"" and ""diffrent"" should be ""different.""
   - Be mindful of parallel structure, especially in lists: ""rolling hills, tumbleweed rolling by, and a snake"" could be more effectively written as ""rolling hills, passing tumbleweeds, and a menacing snake.""

5. **Grammar and Mechanics:**
   - There are several grammatical errors that need correction. Ensure subject-verb agreement, correct verb tenses, and proper punctuation. For example, ""He started out strong until he got to the first town, which was totally abandoned"" could be revised to ""He started out strong but encountered his first challenge upon reaching a completely desolate town.""
   - Proofread for spelling errors and capitalization issues.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The conclusion should effectively summarize the main points and restate the thesis in a new light. It currently feels abrupt and could be expanded to reinforce how the setting's features critically impacted the cyclist.

Overall, your essay shows a promising grasp of the narrative's key events and their effects on the cyclist. With more precise articulation of the thesis, deeper analysis, improved organization, varied vocabulary, and meticulous attention to","

----- TEACHER PERSONA -----
Here is a persona of the teacher. Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.

----- UPDATED TEACHER PERSONA -----
As a teacher who prioritizes grammatical accuracy and adherence to language conventions, my most high-priority goal is to ensure that each student's writing demonstrates a strong command of grammar and language conventions. This includes crafting clear and grammatically correct thesis statements, developing well-supported arguments with precise sentences, and concluding effectively. I aim for students to create essays with clear and logically structured paragraphs, utilizing varied and accurate vocabulary while maintaining grammatical precision, correct spelling, punctuation, and capitalization throughout their work.

My overall teaching style is centered around precision, clarity, and adherence to language conventions. I provide detailed and constructive feedback that focuses on grammatical accuracy and the development of clear, logically structured arguments.

When interacting with students, I emphasize the importance of clear communication and encourage them to ask questions whenever they encounter difficulties.

My feedback is thorough and aimed at helping students refine their writing skills, ensuring they grasp the nuances of grammar, syntax, and proper usage. I also make it a point to praise correct usage and well-structured arguments, reinforcing positive learning experiences. When reviewing student work, I assess the clarity of their thesis statements, the coherence and relevance of their supporting details, and the precision of their language. Essays that exhibit weak organization, fragmented sentences, or insufficient content development receive specific guidance on how to improve these areas.

I focus not only on identifying errors but also on providing concrete suggestions for enhancement, such as refining vocabulary or restructuring paragraphs for better flow. For strong essays, I commend the logical flow, varied word choice, and adherence to writing conventions, noting how these elements contribute to the overall effectiveness of the piece.

In summary, my teaching approach is methodical and supportive, aiming to enhance students' mastery of the English language through consistent and precise feedback, clear instructions, and an open channel for questions and discussions. By maintaining high standards and providing constructive and specific feedback, I strive to help students become confident and skilled writers.



----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit, affected the cyclist greatly. For starters it says he was traveling through the high desserts which is never a safe thing. He had been drinking he water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was, trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state. From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into A far like substance The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay on the influence of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit"" struggles significantly with clarity, coherence, and adherence to grammatical conventions. The thesis statement is vague and not clearly defined. The essay attempts to discuss how the setting affects the cyclist but lacks specific examples and detailed support from the text, resulting in a superficial response. Many sentences are grammatically incorrect or fragmented, which makes the narrative disjointed and difficult to follow. The organization is weak, with an unclear structure that lacks smooth transitions between ideas. There are numerous spelling and punctuation errors, which further impede readability. Overall, the essay fails to effectively communicate its points due to insufficient content development and weak language control. There is a need for a more structured approach, including a clear thesis, well-supported arguments, and a focus on grammatical accuracy to enhance the overall quality of the writing.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The features of the setting in the essay Do not exceed the posted speed limit affected the cyclist in a negative way. The more and more he rode, he thought more negatively and had alot of doubt. The cyclist was not very confident, he thought he wouldnt make it. For example, when the cyclist notices nothing in sight, his tone changes. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon telling

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic understanding of how the features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist, but it lacks depth and specificity in its analysis. The thesis is not entirely clear and could benefit from a more precise statement. The development of arguments includes some examples from the memoir, but these are not thoroughly analyzed or integrated into a cohesive argument. The writing demonstrates frequent grammatical errors, such as ""alot of doubt"" instead of ""a lot of doubt,"" and issues with sentence structure that impede readability. The organization shows potential but needs clearer, more grammatically correct transitions and topic sentences to enhance the logical flow. The language used is somewhat repetitive and lacks variety, which diminishes the overall impact. While the narrative does employ some transitional phrases, it could be more polished to ensure smoother transitions and a more engaging narrative. Overall, the essay could greatly benefit from a more focused thesis, detailed support from the text, and meticulous proofreading to address grammatical inaccuracies.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The features of the setting affect the cyclist because his body has a hard time adjusting to his life threating situation. The neat and desert atmosphere are draining his body of water, @CAPS1 he needs to keep pedaling on. Also, the terrain is stripped of water, so he doesn't have anything to refuel with.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to address the prompt by discussing how the setting affects the cyclist, but it falls short in several areas. The thesis statement is present but not clearly articulated, and the sentences contain numerous grammatical errors that detract from the overall clarity and readability. The development and support of arguments are weak, with limited evidence from the memoir to substantiate the points made. Additionally, the conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis. Organization is lacking as the essay jumps from one point to another without clear transitions or topic sentences, making it difficult to follow the narrative. The language and style are also problematic, with a limited vocabulary and repetitive sentence structures that do not enhance the essay's persuasiveness. There are significant errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization that further impede readability. Overall, the essay needs substantial improvement in grammatical precision, organization, and the use of supporting evidence to effectively communicate its message.

DOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit 
by Joe Kurmaskie 
FORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece 
of advice for the solo cyclist would be, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers 
who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” It’s not that a group of 
old guys doesn’t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid 
place. Things change. 
At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer 
evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn’t have done was 
let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice 
and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to 
Yosemite National Park. 
They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I 
would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with 
strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town.” 
This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time—say, before the last world war—but 
on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water 
supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool 
pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. 
Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, 
and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had 
been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of 
California in June. 
I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my 
strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the 
neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water 
wouldn’t cool down. It didn’t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. 
The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make 
that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so—a test of my inner spirit. 
Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was 
replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign 
jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. 
The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so 
cruel. 
I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it 
really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased 
past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. 
The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my 
shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June 
simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, 
caused me to laugh. 
It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. 
There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride 
down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d 
be fine. 
Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make 
sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst 
of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. 
In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building—abandoned years 
earlier, by the looks of it—had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A 
sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still 
be seen. 
I hung my head. 
That smoky blues tune “Summertime” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating 
brain. 
I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. 
I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you 
have left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. 
It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some 
expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and 
their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I 
was going to lose consciousness for the last time. 
Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining 
elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear 
were all behind me. 
GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP—IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE 
YOUR BEST BET! 
“And the only bet,” I remember thinking. 
As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an 
overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait—any bait, even 
though I didn’t own a rod or reel. 
An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from 
my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. 
“Where you headed in such a hurry?” 
“Yosemite,” I whispered. 
“Know the best way to get there?” 
I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group 
I’d listened to in Lodi. 
“Yes, sir! I own a very good map.” 
And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.

13,52,"Your essay on ""Winter Hibiscus"" has several areas that need improvement to meet the guidelines provided. Firstly, your thesis statement is unclear and lacks grammatical correctness, making it difficult to grasp the main argument of your response. The development and support of your arguments are minimal, and the sentences used are not grammatically precise, which impacts the clarity of your points. Additionally, the conclusion does not effectively summarize the thesis. The organization of your essay is also problematic; the paragraphs lack logical structure and clear, grammatically correct transitions and topic sentences. The language and style are quite rudimentary, with limited vocabulary and incorrect sentence structures that detract from the overall quality of the essay. In terms of conventions, there are several grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which further hinder readability. To improve, focus on creating a clear, grammatically correct thesis statement, develop your arguments with precise, varied sentences, and ensure your conclusion effectively summarizes your main points. Organize your paragraphs logically, with clear transitions and topic sentences, and pay close attention to grammatical accuracy and correct language usage throughout.",52,"Your essay begins with a clear reference to the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" and the concluding quote, which is commendable. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to meet the high standards of grammatical accuracy and coherent argumentation that we aim for in this class.

1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis statement is somewhat unclear and lacks grammatical precision. For instance, the sentence ""the auther put this paragraph as the concluding thought to stress that Saeng is determined to make a change"" could be more effectively written as ""The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's determination to change.""

2. **Grammatical Errors**: There are several grammatical errors throughout your essay. For example, ""auther"" should be ""author,"" and ""budds"" should be ""buds."" Additionally, ""Saeng's vowed silently to herself"" should be ""Saeng vowed silently to herself."" Attention to detail is crucial, so please proofread your work to catch these errors.

3. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence structure is often awkward and lacks coherence. For example, ""When he grandmother 'comes back' then @PERSON1 will feel as if her grandmother is giving her strength and encouragement to try the test again"" is unclear and confusing. It would be more effective to write, ""When her grandmother 'comes back' through the blooming flower, Saeng feels as if her grandmother is encouraging her to try the test again.""

4. **Supporting Details**: While you provide some reasoning for why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, your arguments need stronger support from the text. For instance, you could elaborate more on Saeng's relationship with her grandmother and how it is symbolized by the hibiscus.

5. **Language and Vocabulary**: Your vocabulary is somewhat limited and repetitive. Try to use a wider range of words to make your essay more engaging. For instance, instead of repeating ""take the test again,"" you could use variations like ""retry the test"" or ""attempt the test once more.""

6. **Transitions**: Your essay lacks smooth transitions between ideas, making it feel disjointed. Use transitional phrases to connect your thoughts more fluidly. For example, you could write, ""Furthermore, the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng's hope and resilience, reminding her of her grandmother's guidance.""

7. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion needs to effectively summarize your main points and tie back to your thesis. Currently, it feels abrupt and incomplete. Consider rewriting it to reinforce the idea that the hibiscus and the memory of her grandmother give Saeng the strength to try again.

In summary, focus on improving grammatical accuracy, refining your thesis statement, elaborating on your supporting details, varying your vocabulary, and enhancing the overall flow of your essay. With these improvements, your writing will become more precise and impactful. Keep working hard, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you need further clarification.","

Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the story with  When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better.  A wave of loss so deep and

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a solid effort but struggles with clarity and structure. The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like its going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when shell retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus comes back to life. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good shell feel good

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic attempt to engage with the prompt, but it lacks clarity and depth. The thesis is not clearly stated, making it difficult for readers to understand the main argument. The development of ideas is minimal and somewhat confusing. For example, instead of explaining why the author concluded the story with a statement about a new beginning, the essay drifts into discussing various unrelated aspects. Grammatical errors such as ""about,"" ""is,"" ""desrves,"" and inconsistent verb tenses detract significantly from the readability and flow of the essay. Additionally, the sentence structures are not varied, and the vocabulary is simple and often used incorrectly, leading to a monotonous tone. The paragraph lacks proper transitions, making it disjointed and hard to follow. There is also a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points made, which weakens the overall argument. For future improvement, the writer should focus on crafting a clear thesis, using varied and precise language, and providing specific examples to support their arguments, all while maintaining grammatical accuracy.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succed, one must keep trying. Saeng will adapt to her new copiuntry in time but not if she spends heer time wishing to go back to her homeland. The hibiscus is a reminder to hers of starting a new and adapting to society. Saeng will retry her drivers test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided lacks clarity and is fraught with grammatical errors, which significantly impede its readability and effectiveness. The thesis statement is somewhat unclear, and the supporting sentences contain numerous mistakes, reducing the impact of the arguments presented. Consequently, the essay does not adequately address the prompt, nor does it remain focused on any coherent argument about Saeng's adaptation to her new country. The sentences are often incomplete or awkwardly structured, further detracting from the essay's overall readability. Additionally, the essay lacks a logical flow, with transitions that are neither smooth nor grammatically correct. The conclusion is abrupt and fails to effectively summarize the thesis, leaving the reader with an incomplete understanding of the author's main points. Improvements in grammatical accuracy, clearer thesis articulation, better organizational structure, and more precise language usage are needed to enhance the quality and coherence of this essay.

DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus 
by Minfong Ho 
Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng
walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist
shop to see if the plant can be purchased. 
It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat
leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in
seemingly random profusion. 
“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy
potted plant by the corner. 
There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals
splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of
recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 
“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. 
A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with
vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into
the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the
bucket. 
Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,
oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had
not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. 
When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and
cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel. 
And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with
purplish petals and white centers. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced. How strange to
see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick
walls or between tiled roofs. 
And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and
found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.
“Dok Malik,” she said,
savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its
tag, “jasmine.” 
One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed
her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could
almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she
combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng
would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. 
Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm
around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed
comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? 
A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a
channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. 
And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. 
It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the
last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.
As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of
the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to
her. 
Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. “Ghup ma laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully.
“Goodness, it’s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?” Then she noticed
the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. 
Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. “Where
did you get it?” 
“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question. 
“How much?” 
For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. 
“That’s all?” Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the 
Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .” 
“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said. 
“Then what else—?” 
“Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” 
“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously. “But how could you? All the seeds for this
vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed
the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. 
“What happened?” she asked, more gently. 
“I—I failed the test,” Saeng said. 
For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the
eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. 
Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng’s hands. “It’s a beautiful
plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.” 
“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. 
“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the
words at home, lest she burst into tears again. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said. 
“I know,” her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t
as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.
That’s what matters.” 
She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her
other hand. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said. “Let’s plant it, right now.” 
She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The
soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair
trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There
was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. 
“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. 
Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and
start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?” 
“I’d love it,” Saeng said. 
Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.
She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,
the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth
watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not
even Mrs. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.
But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. 
The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.
Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng
now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange
before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her
now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against
the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. 
When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the
geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

","FEEDBACK:

Dear Student,

Thank you for your effort in writing this essay on ""Winter Hibiscus."" You’ve highlighted an important aspect of the story and conveyed Saeng’s determination effectively. Here are some points for improvement and strengths to help you develop your writing further:

**Strengths:**
1. **Understanding of the Text:** You have a clear grasp of the story's conclusion and the symbolic meaning behind the hibiscus flower.
2. **Insightful Analysis:** You provided a thoughtful interpretation of Saeng’s vow and how it signifies her perseverance and hope for the future.
3. **Connecting Themes:** You made a meaningful connection between Saeng's determination and her grandmother’s symbolic presence.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Clarity and Consistency:** Ensure that each sentence clearly communicates your ideas. For example, the sentence ""Her grandmother's resemblance is in the flower so if the flower budds, then her grandmother will be back in a sense"" could be rephrased for clarity.
2. **Grammar and Spelling:** Pay attention to grammatical errors and spelling, such as ""auther"" (author) and ""budds"" (buds). Proofreading your essay can help catch these mistakes.
3. **Pronoun Consistency:** Be consistent with pronouns. In the last sentence, ""when he grandmother 'comes back' then @PERSON1"" needs correction. Replace ""@PERSON1"" with ""Saeng"" and ensure pronouns match the subject.
4. **Quotations:** When quoting text, use proper punctuation and ensure it blends smoothly with your sentences. Also, consider integrating your analysis more fluidly with the quoted material.
5. **Depth of Analysis:** While you’ve identified Saeng’s determination, expanding on how this determination impacts her character development throughout the story could add depth to your analysis.

**Revised Example:**
""The author concludes 'Winter Hibiscus' with Saeng's vow: 'when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.' This final thought emphasizes Saeng’s resolve to change her circumstances. Although she failed the test initially, she is determined to try again. The hibiscus flower, symbolizing her grandmother's presence, gives Saeng strength and encouragement. When the hibiscus buds in spring, it signifies her grandmother's spiritual return, motivating Saeng to retake the test with renewed hope and support.""

Keep up the good work, and continue to refine your writing skills. Your insights are valuable, and with some adjustments, you can express them more effectively.

Best,
[Your Name]",0.9457518418136379,0.8915192008767266
14,53,"The essay provided has significant room for improvement in terms of clarity, structure, and content. The thesis statement is vague and lacks grammatical accuracy, which makes it difficult to grasp the central idea at first glance. The arguments are underdeveloped, and the sentences are not constructed with the grammatical precision expected. The conclusion simply reiterates the thesis without effectively summarizing the points made, leading to a lack of cohesion in the overall argument. Furthermore, the organization of the essay is fragmented; paragraphs do not flow logically from one to the next, and transitions are either weak or absent. This, combined with simplistic and sometimes incorrect word choices, undermines the intended message. Additionally, the essay contains numerous grammatical errors, including issues with punctuation and sentence structure, which distract the reader and impede readability. To score higher, the writer should focus on crafting a clear and grammatically correct thesis, developing arguments with well-structured and grammatically accurate sentences, and ensuring that the conclusion effectively encapsulates the main ideas. Improving the logical flow between paragraphs and enhancing word choice will also contribute to a more engaging and effective essay.",53,"You have made an effort to address the prompt; however, your response lacks depth and clarity. The thesis statement is quite generic and does not clearly convey your main argument. To enhance your essay, you should focus on crafting a more precise thesis that explains why the author chose to end the story with this specific paragraph.

Your analysis of Saeng's determination to pass her test is a good start, but it needs further development. Consider including specific examples from the story to support your points. For instance, you could discuss how the changing seasons and the blooming hibiscus symbolize hope and renewal for Saeng, which ties into her decision to retake the test in the spring.

Additionally, there are several grammatical issues that need attention. For instance, ""its"" should be ""it's"" to correctly use the contraction for ""it is."" Also, ""determind"" should be ""determined."" Ensure your sentences are complete and grammatically correct to enhance readability.

To improve your essay, focus on the following:
1. **Thesis Statement**: Refine your thesis to clearly state why the author concludes with this paragraph.
2. **Content Development**: Provide specific examples from the story to support your argument about Saeng's determination and the symbolism of the blooming hibiscus.
3. **Grammar and Language**: Pay close attention to grammatical accuracy, spelling, and punctuation. Varied sentence structures and precise vocabulary will make your essay more engaging and readable.
4. **Organization**: Structure your paragraphs logically with smooth transitions to create a cohesive flow of ideas.

By addressing these areas, you can create a more detailed and compelling essay that effectively responds to the prompt.","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memoreies of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring. This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The concluding paragraph of the essay presents several issues related to clarity, structure, and content. The overall message is somewhat muddled due to confusing syntax and word choice, which detracts from the intended emphasis on the author's memories of her homeland. The paragraph could benefit from more precise language and a clearer connection between the memories evoked by the spring season and the author's decision to retake her driving test. Additionally, the development of the argument lacks coherence, with details about animals and blossoming trees feeling tangential and underdeveloped. The organization is also weak, as transitions between sentences are abrupt, making the narrative hard to follow. Furthermore, grammatical errors such as ""memoreies,"" ""beautifu,"" and several awkward phrasings, impede readability and distract from the content. To improve, the essay should focus on refining sentence structures, ensuring grammatical accuracy, and creating a more logical flow of ideas to effectively convey the emotional significance of the author's memories.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like its going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when shell retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus comes back to life. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good shell feel good

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic attempt to engage with the prompt, but it lacks clarity and depth. The thesis is not clearly stated, making it difficult for readers to understand the main argument. The development of ideas is minimal and somewhat confusing. For example, instead of explaining why the author concluded the story with a statement about a new beginning, the essay drifts into discussing various unrelated aspects. Grammatical errors such as ""about,"" ""is,"" ""desrves,"" and inconsistent verb tenses detract significantly from the readability and flow of the essay. Additionally, the sentence structures are not varied, and the vocabulary is simple and often used incorrectly, leading to a monotonous tone. The paragraph lacks proper transitions, making it disjointed and hard to follow. There is also a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points made, which weakens the overall argument. For future improvement, the writer should focus on crafting a clear thesis, using varied and precise language, and providing specific examples to support their arguments, all while maintaining grammatical accuracy.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the story with  When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better.  A wave of loss so deep and

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a solid effort but struggles with clarity and structure. The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.

DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus 
by Minfong Ho 
Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng
walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist
shop to see if the plant can be purchased. 
It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat
leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in
seemingly random profusion. 
“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy
potted plant by the corner. 
There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals
splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of
recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 
“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. 
A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with
vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into
the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the
bucket. 
Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,
oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had
not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. 
When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and
cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel. 
And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with
purplish petals and white centers. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced. How strange to
see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick
walls or between tiled roofs. 
And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and
found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.
“Dok Malik,” she said,
savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its
tag, “jasmine.” 
One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed
her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could
almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she
combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng
would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. 
Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm
around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed
comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? 
A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a
channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. 
And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. 
It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the
last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.
As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of
the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to
her. 
Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. “Ghup ma laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully.
“Goodness, it’s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?” Then she noticed
the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. 
Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. “Where
did you get it?” 
“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question. 
“How much?” 
For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. 
“That’s all?” Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the 
Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .” 
“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said. 
“Then what else—?” 
“Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” 
“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously. “But how could you? All the seeds for this
vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed
the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. 
“What happened?” she asked, more gently. 
“I—I failed the test,” Saeng said. 
For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the
eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. 
Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng’s hands. “It’s a beautiful
plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.” 
“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. 
“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the
words at home, lest she burst into tears again. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said. 
“I know,” her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t
as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.
That’s what matters.” 
She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her
other hand. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said. “Let’s plant it, right now.” 
She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The
soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair
trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There
was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. 
“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. 
Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and
start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?” 
“I’d love it,” Saeng said. 
Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.
She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,
the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth
watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not
even Mrs. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.
But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. 
The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.
Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng
now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange
before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her
now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against
the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. 
When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the
geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its a very good ending paragraph that grabs your attention a little bit. Also it shows that the girl is determined to pass her test, so that makes you think this is a determind story. This is why the author concluded the story with this paragraph.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay! Here are some specific points of feedback to help you improve:

1. **Clarity and Specificity**: Your essay could benefit from more specific details. For instance, instead of stating that ""it's a very good ending paragraph that grabs your attention,"" explain exactly what makes it attention-grabbing. Is it the suspense, the language, or perhaps the character's resolve?

2. **Sentence Structure**: Try to vary your sentence structure to make your writing more engaging. For example, instead of saying ""Also it shows that the girl is determined to pass her test,"" you might say, ""Additionally, the girl's determination to pass her test is clearly depicted.""

3. **Grammar and Spelling**: Pay attention to grammar and proper word usage. ""Its"" should be ""it's"" (it is), and ""determind"" should be ""determined."" Small errors like these can detract from your overall message.

4. **Depth of Analysis**: Dive deeper into why the ending is effective. Discuss how the author's choice of words, the development of the character, and the story arc contribute to a satisfying conclusion.

5. **Structure and Coherence**: Ensure that each sentence logically follows the previous one and that your paragraph has a clear beginning, middle, and end. This will help your reader follow your argument more easily.

Here’s a revised version incorporating these points:

""The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it effectively captures the reader's attention through its suspenseful tone and the vivid portrayal of the protagonist's determination. The girl's resolve to pass her test is not only a testament to her character but also serves as a powerful conclusion that underscores the theme of perseverance. This deliberate choice by the author ensures that readers are left with a lasting impression of the story's message.""

15,54,"Your essay demonstrates an effort to address the question, but it falls short in several key areas. The thesis, which aims to explain why the author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a particular paragraph, is not clearly articulated. While you attempt to provide examples from the story, the connections between these examples and the thesis are unclear and underdeveloped. This results in a response that feels somewhat disjointed and unfocused. While your language shows some grasp of grammar and spelling, frequent errors detract from the overall readability and clarity. Moreover, the narrative flow is inconsistent, making it challenging for readers to follow your argument. To improve, ensure that your thesis is explicitly stated and supported with well-chosen, specific examples from the text. Additionally, focus on varying your sentence structures and refining your grammatical accuracy to enhance the overall clarity and impact of your writing.",54,"Your essay demonstrates a commendable effort to engage with the text and explain why the author concluded the story with the specific paragraph in question. However, there are several areas that need improvement to enhance clarity, grammar, and overall effectiveness.

1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis statement, which suggests that the conclusion has a ""touching"" effect and sums up the points of the story, lacks precision and clarity. Consider revising it to more explicitly state your main argument. For example: ""The concluding paragraph of 'Winter Hibiscus' is impactful because it encapsulates Saeng's emotional journey and the themes of adaptation and resilience.""

2. **Grammar and Language**: There are multiple grammatical errors that detract from the readability of your essay. For example, ""author lend them many different ways"" should be ""authors end stories in many different ways."" Additionally, ""touching affect"" should be ""touching effect,"" and ""paints talked about"" should be ""points discussed."" Please proofread your work to correct these errors.

3. **Supporting Evidence**: While you do provide quotes from the story, your analysis of these quotes is somewhat superficial and repetitive. For instance, you mention the touching effect twice without expanding on how the imagery of a ""silent lonely girl"" contributes to this effect. Provide more detailed explanations and connect them back to your thesis more clearly.

4. **Organization and Structure**: Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Introduce each point with a topic sentence, provide evidence, analyze the evidence, and then link it back to your thesis. This will help create a logical flow and make your argument more coherent.

5. **Vocabulary and Sentence Variety**: Your essay uses simple vocabulary and repetitive sentence structures. Try to incorporate more varied and precise language. For example, instead of ""touching effect,"" you might use ""emotional resonance"" or ""poignant impact.""

6. **Conclusion**: The conclusion of your essay is brief and does not effectively summarize your main points or restate your thesis. Strengthen your conclusion by summarizing how the final paragraph of the story ties together the themes and emotional journey of the protagonist.

For example:
""In conclusion, the final paragraph of 'Winter Hibiscus' effectively consolidates the themes of adaptation and resilience by evoking strong imagery and revisiting key elements of Saeng's experience. The author's use of vivid descriptions and symbolic references to the hibiscus and geese enhances the emotional impact, making the reader feel the depth of Saeng's silent vow to persevere and retake the test in the spring.""

By focusing on these areas for improvement, you can create a more polished and compelling essay. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you need further clarification or assistance.","

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic attempt to engage with the prompt, but it lacks clarity and depth. The thesis is not clearly stated, making it difficult for readers to understand the main argument. The development of ideas is minimal and somewhat confusing. For example, instead of explaining why the author concluded the story with a statement about a new beginning, the essay drifts into discussing various unrelated aspects. Grammatical errors such as ""about,"" ""is,"" ""desrves,"" and inconsistent verb tenses detract significantly from the readability and flow of the essay. Additionally, the sentence structures are not varied, and the vocabulary is simple and often used incorrectly, leading to a monotonous tone. The paragraph lacks proper transitions, making it disjointed and hard to follow. There is also a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points made, which weakens the overall argument. For future improvement, the writer should focus on crafting a clear thesis, using varied and precise language, and providing specific examples to support their arguments, all while maintaining grammatical accuracy.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the story with  When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again For many good reasons.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a solid effort but struggles with clarity and structure. The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succed, one must keep trying. Saeng will adapt to her new copiuntry in time but not if she spends heer time wishing to go back to her homeland. The hibiscus is a reminder to hers of starting a new and adapting to society. Saeng will retry her drivers test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided lacks clarity and is fraught with grammatical errors, which significantly impede its readability and effectiveness. The thesis statement is somewhat unclear, and the supporting sentences contain numerous mistakes, reducing the impact of the arguments presented. Consequently, the essay does not adequately address the prompt, nor does it remain focused on any coherent argument about Saeng's adaptation to her new country. The sentences are often incomplete or awkwardly structured, further detracting from the essay's overall readability. Additionally, the essay lacks a logical flow, with transitions that are neither smooth nor grammatically correct. The conclusion is abrupt and fails to effectively summarize the thesis, leaving the reader with an incomplete understanding of the author's main points. Improvements in grammatical accuracy, clearer thesis articulation, better organizational structure, and more precise language usage are needed to enhance the quality and coherence of this essay.

DOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus 
by Minfong Ho 
Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng
walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist
shop to see if the plant can be purchased. 
It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat
leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in
seemingly random profusion. 
“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy
potted plant by the corner. 
There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals
splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of
recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 
“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. 
A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with
vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into
the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the
bucket. 
Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,
oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had
not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. 
When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and
cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel. 
And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with
purplish petals and white centers. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced. How strange to
see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick
walls or between tiled roofs. 
And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and
found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.
“Dok Malik,” she said,
savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its
tag, “jasmine.” 
One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed
her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could
almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she
combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng
would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. 
Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm
around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed
comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? 
A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a
channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. 
And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. 
It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the
last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.
As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of
the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to
her. 
Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. “Ghup ma laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully.
“Goodness, it’s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?” Then she noticed
the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. 
Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. “Where
did you get it?” 
“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question. 
“How much?” 
For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. 
“That’s all?” Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the 
Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .” 
“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said. 
“Then what else—?” 
“Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” 
“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously. “But how could you? All the seeds for this
vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed
the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. 
“What happened?” she asked, more gently. 
“I—I failed the test,” Saeng said. 
For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the
eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. 
Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng’s hands. “It’s a beautiful
plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.” 
“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. 
“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the
words at home, lest she burst into tears again. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said. 
“I know,” her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t
as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.
That’s what matters.” 
She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her
other hand. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said. “Let’s plant it, right now.” 
She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The
soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair
trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There
was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. 
“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. 
Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and
start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?” 
“I’d love it,” Saeng said. 
Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.
She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,
the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth
watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not
even Mrs. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.
But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. 
The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.
Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng
now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange
before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her
now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against
the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. 
When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the
geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: In stories, author lend them many different ways with many different effects. In the story, Winter Hibiscus the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has a touching affect to the reader and it basically sums up all the paints talked about in the story. The first example, is in the beginning of the conclusion, it says Saeng vowed silently to herself. In this unique quote, the author demonstrates imagery by giving you a mental picture of a silent lonly girl nealing down in the cold garden, whispering silently to herself. This quote and this part of the quote has a touching effect to the reader. Another example of why the author concludes the story with this is because it sums up all the parts covered in the story. ""When the geese return hibiscus is budding I will take that test again This quote mentions the hibiscus which is mentioned a lot throughout, the geese in the end, and the failing of the test in the beginning. In conclusion, thats why the author used that paragraph as the conclusion for such a touching story.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","**FEEDBACK:**

Thank you for your efforts on this essay! You have made a good attempt at analyzing the conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" and its effects on the reader. Here are some areas where you can improve and some suggestions to help you:

1. **Clarity and Structure:**
   - Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Begin with an introductory paragraph that briefly introduces the story and your main argument.
   - Each paragraph should focus on a single point or example that supports your argument. Use topic sentences to make it clear what each paragraph will discuss.

2. **Grammar and Syntax:**
   - Pay attention to your grammar and syntax. For example, ""author lend them many different ways"" should be ""authors end their stories in many different ways.""
   - Make sure each sentence is complete and clear. For instance, ""In the story, Winter Hibiscus the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has a 'touching' affect to the reader and it basically sums up all the paints talked about in the story"" can be improved to: ""In 'Winter Hibiscus,' the author concludes the story with a touching paragraph that effectively sums up the main points discussed throughout.""

3. **Word Choice:**
   - Be careful with word choice. The word ""affect"" should be ""effect"" in this context. Also, ""paints"" should be ""points.""
   - Avoid repetition by finding synonyms and varying your sentence structure.

4. **Evidence and Analysis:**
   - Your essay mentions quotes from the story, which is great. However, each quote should be followed by a more detailed analysis that ties it back to your main argument. Explain why the imagery is unique and how it contributes to the touching effect.
   - Make sure to provide a bit more context for each quote to help the reader understand its significance within the story.

5. **Polish and Proofread:**
   - Always proofread your work for spelling errors and typos. For example, ""lonly"" should be ""lonely,"" and ""nealing"" should be ""kneeling.""
   - Consider reading your essay out loud to catch any errors or awkward phrasing.

Here is a revised version of your first paragraph to illustrate some of these points:

---

**Revised Paragraph:**

In literature, authors conclude their stories in various ways to invoke different effects on the reader. In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author ends the story with a poignant paragraph that deeply touches the reader and encapsulates the central themes of the narrative. For example, the phrase ""Saeng vowed silently to herself"" creates a vivid image of a lonely girl kneeling in the cold garden, whispering her resolve. This imagery provides a powerful emotional connection for the reader. Furthermore, the line ""When the geese return and hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" ties together key elements from the story: the hibiscus mentioned throughout, the ge",0.9421169258165393,0.9234077111950825
16,56,"The essay demonstrates a heartfelt and engaging narrative, providing a vivid portrayal of the challenges and joys of immigrant life. The author effectively conveys the cultural richness and familial bonds in their upbringing, using specific examples from the memoir to support their points. However, the essay sometimes lacks clarity in connecting back to a clear thesis statement, making it difficult to fully grasp the central argument. While the content is interesting and flows smoothly, occasional grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures detract from its overall clarity and polish. The language is generally good, with a varied vocabulary that enhances the narrative, but there are instances where word choice could be more precise. Overall, the essay offers a meaningful reflection on the importance of family and cultural heritage, yet it could be strengthened by a more defined thesis and attention to grammatical precision.",56,"Your essay offers a thoughtful reflection on the memoir ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."" You successfully highlight the main themes of family, culture, and the creation of a warm home environment despite challenges. However, there are several areas that need improvement to enhance clarity, structure, and grammatical accuracy.

Firstly, your thesis statement is somewhat vague and could be more specific. A clearer thesis would help anchor your essay and guide your arguments more effectively. For instance, you might specify the exact mood created by the memoir and how the author achieves this.

Your essay contains several instances of informal language and phrases that could be more precise. For example, ""from what I've known, heard and seen"" could be rephrased to ""based on my observations and knowledge."" Additionally, the phrase ""a side of racism and discrimination occasionally"" is somewhat awkward; consider rephrasing for clarity and grammatical correctness.

There are also some grammatical errors and issues with sentence structure. For instance, ""Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally"" is a run-on sentence and could be split for better clarity. Furthermore, the phrase ""This quote kind of lightens up the whole idea of this memoir"" is colloquial and imprecise. Instead, you could write, ""This quote encapsulates the memoir's central theme of finding joy and community amidst adversity.""

Your use of evidence from the memoir is commendable, but it would benefit from more detailed analysis. After presenting the quote, delve deeper into how it supports the mood you identified. Explain how the specific elements of family gatherings, cultural traditions, and celebrations contribute to the overall atmosphere of warmth and resilience.

The organization of your essay could also be improved. Ensure each paragraph transitions smoothly to the next and that your ideas are logically ordered. For example, start with a strong introduction that includes your refined thesis, followed by body paragraphs that each address a specific point supported by evidence from the text.

Lastly, pay attention to spelling, punctuation, and capitalization throughout your essay. Consistent errors in these areas can detract from the overall quality and readability of your writing.

In summary, while your essay effectively touches on the memoir's key themes, refining your thesis, enhancing grammatical accuracy, improving sentence structure, and providing deeper analysis will significantly strengthen your work. Keep practicing these elements, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you encounter difficulties. Your engagement with the text is evident, and with these improvements, you will be able to convey your insights more clearly and effectively.","

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a heartfelt and detailed account of the author's upbringing in a traditional Cuban home. The narrative effectively evokes a warm and comforting mood, supported by specific examples from the memoir. However, there are several grammatical errors and inconsistencies that detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. For instance, the use of ""@CAPS1"" appears to be a placeholder or redaction, which disrupts the flow of the text and makes it difficult to follow. Additionally, there are punctuation issues, such as the use of ampersands (&) instead of ""and,"" and some sentences are overly complex or improperly structured. The organization of the essay is mostly clear, with logical progression from one idea to the next, but some transitions could be smoother. The vocabulary is somewhat varied, though there are instances of repetition and incorrect usage. Overall, while the essay is interesting and provides a vivid portrayal of the author's family life, it would benefit greatly from a thorough review to correct grammatical errors and improve sentence structure.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======

A quote that shows this is ""the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay in question demonstrates a clear effort to convey the memoir's themes of friendship and family. However, it falls short in several key areas. The thesis statement is somewhat unclear and lacks grammatical accuracy. The arguments are presented, but they lack depth and sufficient development, making the supporting evidence seem superficial. Additionally, the sentences are grammatically correct but often simplistic and repetitive, leading to a lack of complexity and variation in word choice and sentence structure. The organization of the essay is weak, with transitions and topic sentences that do not effectively guide the reader through the argument. Furthermore, there are noticeable errors in spelling and punctuation, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. To improve, the writer should focus on crafting a clear and grammatically correct thesis statement, developing arguments with greater depth and precision, and ensuring that transitions and topic sentences are logically structured and grammatically accurate. Enhanced vocabulary and varied sentence structures would also contribute to a more engaging and effective essay.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a solid effort but struggles with clarity and structure. The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.

DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 5 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Narciso Rodriguez 
from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives 
My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a 
furnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old 
Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon 
call home. 
In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the 
Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our 
traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared 
cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking 
that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which 
I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of 
childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed 
both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. 
Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that “family” had nothing to do with 
being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, 
Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation 
prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these 
cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of 
honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their 
own kind, were clearly in need. 
Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and 
Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio 
and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not 
know my “real” grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were 
allowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and 
Rosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family 
members came and went — and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they 
were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the 
many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. 
My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the 
language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a 
better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country 
they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters 
while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were 
strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind 
of jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had 
studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, 
taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their 
children to better times drove them to endure these hard times. 
I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I’ve often told them that what 
they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I’ve often told them of 
my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I’ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in 
reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at 
such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two 
lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these 
teachings have been the basis of my life. 
It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to 
this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this 
humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not 
just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of “family.” 
And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I 
learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into 
a home.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Living life in a country or place away can be very difficult from what I've known, heard and seen. Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally. Nonetheless, this well-told memoir tells of the contentment and good side of it all. The happiness that was created in a place that Narciso calls home. In the home, he still got to experience Cuban culture including music, traditional cooking and best of all ambiance of family being around. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote kind of lightens up the whole idea of this memoir and how people from all over came together to celebrate the wonderful joys of life even though at times they were frowned upon.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Dear [Student's Name],

Thank you for sharing your essay with me. You have touched upon some important themes and presented a thoughtful reflection on Narciso's experiences. Here are a few points of feedback based on the values I hold dear in writing:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: Your essay introduces some complex ideas, but at times it can be challenging to follow your line of thought. Try to ensure that each sentence clearly connects to the next. For instance, you might want to elaborate more on how poverty, racism, and discrimination are juxtaposed with the happiness and contentment Narciso finds in his home.

2. **Specificity and Detail**: Providing specific examples can make your essay more vivid and engaging. You mention Cuban culture, music, and traditional cooking—consider adding a few more details or anecdotes to bring these elements to life for the reader.

3. **Grammar and Syntax**: Pay attention to sentence structure and grammar. For example, the first sentence reads, ""Living life in a country or place away can be very difficult from what I've known, heard and seen."" This could be clearer if rephrased to something like, ""Living in a different country can be very challenging, as I’ve come to understand from various accounts."" Also, be mindful of subject-verb agreement and punctuation throughout your essay.

4. **Quotation Integration**: You included a powerful quote, which is great, but try to integrate it more smoothly into your essay. Explain its significance and how it ties into your overall argument. You might say, ""This quote illuminates the core of Narciso's memoir, highlighting how the warmth of family and cultural traditions can create a sense of home and joy, even in the face of external challenges.""

5. **Conclusion and Reflection**: Your essay would benefit from a stronger conclusion that ties together your main points and offers a final reflection on why Narciso’s story is significant. What can readers learn from his experience? How does it resonate with broader themes of resilience and cultural identity?

Overall, your essay has a strong foundation, and with some refinement, it can become even more impactful. Keep up the good work, and continue to think deeply about the themes you wish to explore.

Best regards,

17,57,"The essay effectively captures the mood created by the author and provides specific evidence from the memoir to support the statements made. It clearly articulates the emotions of happiness, curiosity, and sadness elicited by the narrative. However, the response occasionally deviates from the focus, such as when it wonders about the reasons behind the parents' actions, which slightly detracts from the main analysis. The grammar and spelling have several errors, including incorrect capitalization and punctuation, which interrupt the flow of the essay and reduce its overall clarity. Additionally, the vocabulary is somewhat limited and repetitive, lacking the variation necessary for a higher level of sophistication. Transitions between ideas are present but are not always smooth, making parts of the narrative feel disjointed. Overall, the essay demonstrates an understanding of the memoir, but it could benefit from more precise language use, better organization, and a stronger adherence to the central question.",57,"Your essay displays a commendable effort to engage with the text and explore the moods created by the author. You've effectively identified multiple emotions, such as happiness, curiosity, and sadness, and supported your points with relevant quotes from the memoir. However, there are several areas that need refinement to enhance the clarity and coherence of your essay.

1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis statement is apparent, but it could benefit from greater precision and grammatical accuracy. Consider refining it to clearly state the main moods you intend to discuss. For example: ""The author creates a happy yet curious mood, while also evoking sadness, to illustrate the complex emotions surrounding his family's immigration story.""

2. **Supporting Arguments**: While you have included quotes from the memoir, your analysis of these quotes could be more detailed. Rather than simply stating that the quotes made you feel a certain way, delve deeper into how the author's word choices and descriptions contribute to these moods.

3. **Sentence Structure and Grammar**: There are several grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures that impede the flow of your essay. For instance, ""Narciso mom"" should be ""Narciso's mom,"" and ""This made me wonder why they would do this"" could be clarified. Additionally, the use of placeholders like ""@LOCATION1"" and ""@MONTH1"" disrupts the reading experience. Ensure all placeholders are replaced with the appropriate information.

4. **Vocabulary and Word Choice**: Aim for more varied and precise vocabulary. Words like ""happy"" and ""sad"" are somewhat simplistic; using more descriptive terms can add depth to your analysis. For example, instead of ""happy,"" you might say ""uplifted"" or ""joyful,"" and instead of ""sad,"" you might say ""melancholic"" or ""heart-wrenching.""

5. **Organization and Transitions**: Your essay would benefit from smoother transitions between ideas. Each paragraph should clearly link back to your thesis and build on the previous point. For example, you could use transitional phrases like ""Furthermore,"" ""Additionally,"" or ""Conversely"" to guide the reader through your argument.

6. **Spelling and Punctuation**: Pay close attention to spelling and punctuation. Words like ""carrers"" should be corrected to ""careers,"" and ensure proper capitalization throughout your essay (e.g., ""Studied"" should be ""studied"").

7. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion should effectively summarize the main points of your essay and restate the thesis in a new light. Ensure it ties all the moods you've discussed back to the overall impact of the memoir.

**Revised Example**:

The author creates a varied emotional landscape in the memoir, evoking happiness, curiosity, and sadness to illustrate the complexities of his family's immigration experience. The happiness stems from Narciso's optimistic upbringing, while curiosity arises from the sacrifices his parents made for his future. For instance, the author notes that his parents ""start their lives over entirely,","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", tells us of how @CAPS1 grew up with his parents who which immigrated from Cuba, the mood created by the author is warm & comforting.For example, the mood is comforting because, @CAPS1 speaks of how, his parents created a traditional Cuban home, out of nothing but a one bedroom apartment. @CAPS1 descrbes his life being centered around the kitchen & his parent always provideing what they could the best for him.""@CAPS1 also states ""I will always be grateful to my

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a heartfelt and detailed account of the author's upbringing in a traditional Cuban home. The narrative effectively evokes a warm and comforting mood, supported by specific examples from the memoir. However, there are several grammatical errors and inconsistencies that detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. For instance, the use of ""@CAPS1"" appears to be a placeholder or redaction, which disrupts the flow of the text and makes it difficult to follow. Additionally, there are punctuation issues, such as the use of ampersands (&) instead of ""and,"" and some sentences are overly complex or improperly structured. The organization of the essay is mostly clear, with logical progression from one idea to the next, but some transitions could be smoother. The vocabulary is somewhat varied, though there are instances of repetition and incorrect usage. Overall, while the essay is interesting and provides a vivid portrayal of the author's family life, it would benefit greatly from a thorough review to correct grammatical errors and improve sentence structure.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created in this memoir is friendship. One reason is because his parents let the door open for the peope they considered family. A quote that shows this is ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors to the many people we consider family. This shows that the mood is friendship because his parents are great friends to their family.        A second reason is the importance of friend ship. A quote that shows this is ""the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay in question demonstrates a clear effort to convey the memoir's themes of friendship and family. However, it falls short in several key areas. The thesis statement is somewhat unclear and lacks grammatical accuracy. The arguments are presented, but they lack depth and sufficient development, making the supporting evidence seem superficial. Additionally, the sentences are grammatically correct but often simplistic and repetitive, leading to a lack of complexity and variation in word choice and sentence structure. The organization of the essay is weak, with transitions and topic sentences that do not effectively guide the reader through the argument. Furthermore, there are noticeable errors in spelling and punctuation, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. To improve, the writer should focus on crafting a clear and grammatically correct thesis statement, developing arguments with greater depth and precision, and ensuring that transitions and topic sentences are logically structured and grammatically accurate. Enhanced vocabulary and varied sentence structures would also contribute to a more engaging and effective essay.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the story with  When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better.  A wave of loss so deep and

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a solid effort but struggles with clarity and structure. The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.

DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 5 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Narciso Rodriguez 
from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives 
My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a 
furnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old 
Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon 
call home. 
In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the 
Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our 
traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared 
cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking 
that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which 
I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of 
childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed 
both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. 
Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that “family” had nothing to do with 
being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, 
Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation 
prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these 
cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of 
honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their 
own kind, were clearly in need. 
Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and 
Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio 
and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not 
know my “real” grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were 
allowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and 
Rosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family 
members came and went — and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they 
were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the 
many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. 
My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the 
language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a 
better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country 
they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters 
while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were 
strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind 
of jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had 
studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, 
taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their 
children to better times drove them to endure these hard times. 
I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I’ve often told them that what 
they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I’ve often told them of 
my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I’ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in 
reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at 
such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two 
lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these 
teachings have been the basis of my life. 
It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to 
this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this 
humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not 
just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of “family.” 
And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I 
learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into 
a home.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author creates a very happy, but curious mood towards the reader. The reading made me happy for Narciso, but curious on how much his parents had to struggle to give Narciso the best life he could get. For example the author states that his parents had to ""start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find."" Back in Cuba, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso mom) had Studied chemical engineering."" This shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to @LOCATION1. This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved."" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again. The author creates a variety of different moods throught the memoir.

**Feedback:**

Dear [Student's Name],

Thank you for your thoughtful essay on the author's depiction of emotions and the struggles faced by Narciso's family. You did a commendable job of identifying the different moods created by the author and how they impacted you as a reader. Here are some specific points to consider:

1. **Mood Analysis:**
   - You have effectively highlighted the happy and curious mood created by the author's descriptions. Your understanding of how the family's sacrifices evoked these feelings is clear and insightful.

2. **Textual Evidence:**
   - You've included relevant quotations to support your points, which is excellent. However, remember to format your quotes correctly and provide proper citations if this is a requirement for your assignment.

3. **Clarity and Detail:**
   - Your essay could benefit from more detailed analysis. For example, you mention feeling curious about the parents' struggles but don't delve deeply into what specific challenges they might have faced or how this curiosity enhances the narrative.

4. **Emotion and Personal Reflection:**
   - You've done well in reflecting on how the text made you feel, particularly with the sadness evoked by the immigrants' sacrifices. Personal reflections like these add depth to your analysis.

5. **Grammar and Conventions:**
   - There are a few grammatical errors and typos that need attention. For instance, ""Narciso mom"" should be ""Narciso's mom,"" and ""throught"" should be ""throughout."" Be sure to proofread your work to catch these errors.
   - Additionally, placeholders like ""@LOCATION1"" and ""@MONTH1"" should be replaced with specific details to maintain coherence.

6. **Structure and Coherence:**
   - Your essay has a good structure, but try to ensure each paragraph flows logically into the next. Transition sentences can help connect your ideas more smoothly.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - While you hinted at the variety of moods created in the memoir, summarizing these points more explicitly in your conclusion would strengthen your essay.

Overall, you've made a strong start! Paying attention to these details will enhance the clarity and impact of your writing. Keep up the good work, and continue to explore and express your insights with confidence.

18,65,"The essay provides a clear main thesis that argues the benefits of using computers, supported by practical examples. However, the development of the arguments is somewhat simplistic and could benefit from more detailed and varied evidence. The structure is fairly organized with a basic introduction, body, and conclusion, but the transitions between ideas are not always smooth, and some points feel repetitive. The word choice is functional but lacks variety and precision, which makes the writing less engaging. Sentence structure is mostly straightforward, though occasionally mechanical, which impacts the overall flow of the essay. The essay demonstrates a good grasp of standard writing conventions, with minimal errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, contributing to its readability. Overall, while the essay is clear and practical, it could be improved by adding more depth to the arguments, enhancing the transitions, and using a more sophisticated vocabulary and varied sentence structures.",65,"Dear [Student's Name],

Thank you for your effort in writing this letter to the local newspaper. I can see that you have put thought into the reasons why computers are beneficial, which is a great start. Below, I have provided detailed feedback to help you improve your essay and align it more closely with the expectations of clear, practical, and effective writing.

1. **Ideas & Content**: 
   - Your essay presents a clear opinion about the benefits of computers, which is good. However, the examples you provided are somewhat generic and lack depth. For instance, when you mention using the computer to learn about new places, it would be more convincing to include specific examples of places you've learned about and how this knowledge has benefited you.
   - Similarly, the statistics you cited (e.g., “@PERCENT1 of the time”) are vague. Including real-world examples or more precise data would strengthen your argument significantly. For example, refer to a study or a credible source that supports your claims about the benefits of computers.

2. **Organization**:
   - Your essay has a basic structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, which is good. However, the flow of ideas can be improved. Make sure each paragraph has a clear topic sentence and that your arguments are logically organized.
   - Transitions between points could be smoother. For instance, use connecting phrases like “Furthermore,” “In addition,” or “Moreover” to guide the reader through your arguments more effectively.

3. **Word Choice**:
   - Your word choice is generally clear, but at times it is too informal. For example, phrases like “another example is” can be replaced with more varied and precise language. 
   - Avoid repetitive phrases and try to use a broader range of vocabulary to make your writing more engaging. Instead of repeatedly saying “for example,” you could use expressions like “an instance of this is,” “such as,” or “to illustrate this point.”

4. **Sentence Fluency**:
   - Some of your sentences are awkwardly constructed and repetitive. For instance, “when I'm doing research it always gives me the ability to learn about new places and people” could be simplified to “researching on the computer allows me to learn about new places and people.” 
   - Varying sentence length and structure will help improve readability and keep the reader’s interest. Try combining shorter sentences into more complex ones where appropriate.

5. **Conventions**:
   - There are several grammatical errors and issues with punctuation, capitalization, and spelling that need to be addressed. For example, “alot” should be “a lot,” and “whenever” should be “when ever” in the context you used.
   - Proofreading your work or using a spelling and grammar check tool can help identify and correct these errors. Proper use of conventions enhances clarity and professionalism.

**Practical Suggestions**:
- **Revise your thesis statement**: Make","

Here is a persona of the teacher. Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.

----- UPDATED TEACHER PERSONA -----

The teacher's primary goal is to enhance students' abilities to write clearly, practically, and effectively, ensuring they can articulate their thoughts and support their arguments with real-world examples. This skill is deemed essential not only for academic success but for real-life applications in both professional and personal contexts. The teacher emphasizes clear thesis statements, logical organization, practical language, and impeccable grammar to equip students with the necessary tools to communicate coherently and persuasively.

Their teaching style is grounded in clarity, practicality, and real-world relevance. The teacher consistently provides feedback in a clear, concise, and actionable manner, helping students identify strengths and areas for improvement with concrete examples and practical suggestions. They focus on offering constructive criticism that highlights the importance of developing a clear thesis, well-structured arguments, and supporting claims with detailed real-world examples. Grammar, spelling, and punctuation are frequent points of emphasis, ensuring students understand the significance of these elements in producing polished and professional writing.

Interaction with students is characterized by open communication and approachability, encouraging questions and clarifications while fostering a supportive environment where making mistakes is seen as a valuable learning opportunity. The teacher values detailed feedback and is diligent in pointing out areas that require significant improvement, such as clarity, organization, coherence, and the use of precise vocabulary.

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear editor, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I believe that computers are a benefit to the world, and people as well. I say this because lots of people can talk to family of friends long distance. Also the computer can teach you lots of thing. Finally it makes you more social. In @CAPS1 strong opinion computers are better for the world. Firstly, many people can talk long distance with family of friends. You have web cam and that allows you to chat and see the person. Also @CAPS2 is another site

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and relevant thesis statement regarding the benefits of computers, and the main ideas are adequately supported with examples. However, the arguments could benefit from more specific real-world examples and pragmatic reasoning to strengthen the claims. The essay is organized with an introduction, body, and conclusion, but the transitions between paragraphs and the overall flow could be improved for a smoother reading experience. The word choice is mostly effective, conveying the intended message clearly, although some phrases lack precision and could be refined for better clarity. The sentence structures are varied but could be more fluid to enhance readability. There are minimal errors in conventions, but attention to correct usage of punctuation, spelling, and capitalization would improve the overall quality. Overall, the essay is clear and focused, but it could be enhanced with better organization, more precise language, and stronger examples to fully meet the teacher's expectations for clarity, practicality, and linguistic precision.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear Newspaper editor I would like to make @CAPS3 about the benifits of owning a computer. For example you can learn many thing you would of never of been able too, you can also go in chat rooms and talk with friends or other people and it can even make teaching esyer too. Computers in many countres are standard and we use then to learn many things but if you bring one to the tribes in @LOCATION1 it will look like a alein object but once they know how to use it it can open there eyes for ever

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay you presented demonstrates a genuine enthusiasm for the topic of the benefits of owning a computer, but it requires significant refinement in several areas to meet higher standards. The content is somewhat clear and addresses the prompt, though the examples provided are often broad and lack depth in real-world relevance. Incorporating more specific, illustrative examples would enhance the argument's effectiveness. The organization of the essay is somewhat disjointed, with ideas jumping from one to another without clear transitions or a logical flow. Improving the structure by using well-defined topic sentences and coherent transitions between paragraphs would help. 

In terms of word choice, the essay frequently uses casual and imprecise language, which detracts from its persuasive power. Employing a more formal and precise vocabulary would improve readability and impact. Sentence fluency is also an issue; many sentences are awkwardly constructed and run-on, making the essay difficult to follow at times. Simplifying sentence structures and varying them would help create a smoother reading experience. Finally, conventions are a major area for improvement. The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, incorrect spelling, and improper punctuation, all of which impede readability and distract from the argument. A thorough proofreading to correct these mistakes is essential. Overall, while the essay shows promise in engaging with the topic, it needs significant work in clarity, structure, language precision, and grammatical accuracy to fully persuade the reader.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear local newspaper, I am writing this letter to you to show on how people get effected from computers. It effects people very well and teaches people many things for just one technology. Computers effects many people for what it does. Computers have many advantages that people learn very quickly. Many people love computers. It is one of the most best inventions to everyone around the world. They teach positive things for people to learn. Computer even have a positive effect on people across

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear stance on the positive effects of computers but lacks depth and specificity in its arguments. The thesis is somewhat ambiguous and repetitive, which diminishes its overall clarity and impact. There is an attempt to develop and support the thesis, but the examples provided are general and unconvincing. For instance, the discussion on hand-eye coordination is not thoroughly explained or supported with concrete evidence. The organization of the essay is basic, with a discernible introduction, body, and conclusion; however, the flow of ideas is somewhat disjointed and lacks smooth transitions. The language used is simplistic and at times redundant, which affects the precision and engagement of the writing. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors and awkward sentence constructions that impede readability. To strengthen the essay, it would benefit from a more precise thesis, richer and more specific examples, improved coherence, and careful attention to language and stylistic choices. Overall, the essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the topic but requires significant refinement to meet the teacher's expectations for clarity, practicality, and precision.

More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those
who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people.
They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and
people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Others have different ideas.
Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and
less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. 
Write a letter to your local newspaper in which you state your opinion on the effects
computers have on people. Persuade the readers to agree with you.

TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Dear [Student's Name],

Thank you for your essay submission. I can see that you have put effort into expressing your thoughts on how computers benefit people, and I appreciate your enthusiasm about the subject. Here are some constructive points to help improve your writing:

1. **Structure and Organization**:
   - Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Consider breaking it into distinct paragraphs for each of your reasons. Start with an introduction, followed by separate paragraphs for each reason, and end with a conclusion.
   - Ensure each paragraph starts with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea of that paragraph.

2. **Clarity and Specificity**:
   - Instead of using placeholders like @CAPS1, @NUM1, @ORGANIZATION1, etc., use specific names, places, and numbers. This will make your essay more personal and easier to understand.
   - Be specific about the sources you mention. For example, name the TV channel or website you refer to, and provide accurate statistics if possible.

3. **Grammar and Punctuation**:
   - Pay attention to grammar and punctuation to make your writing clearer. For example, ""In my opinion, I benefit people using computers"" should include a comma.
   - Avoid run-on sentences. Break long sentences into shorter, more manageable ones.
   - Ensure subject-verb agreement. For example, ""they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability…” should be ""they teach hand-eye coordination and give people the ability…""

4. **Examples and Evidence**:
   - Provide clear and relevant examples to support your points. For instance, instead of saying ""for example, when I am always using the computer…,"" specify a particular instance or project where the computer helped you.

5. **Coherence and Flow**:
   - Ensure your essay flows smoothly from one point to the next. Transitional phrases can help guide the reader through your argument.
   - Reiterate your main points in the conclusion to reinforce your argument, but avoid simply repeating the same phrases.

6. **Tone and Persuasiveness**:
   - While it’s good to be confident, stating ""I am a really smart kid"" might come across as boastful. Focus on presenting your points clearly and let the reader conclude your intelligence from the quality of your writing.
   - Make your conclusion compelling. Instead of saying ""please try to make this believable,"" summarize why your points are strong and well-supported.

Here’s a revised version of your introduction to serve as an example:

---

Dear Local Newspaper,

My name is [Your Name]. I am [Your Age] years old and I attend [Your School Name] in [Your Location]. I believe that I benefit people by using computers, and I would like to share with you three compelling reasons why. Firstly, computers enhance hand-eye coordination and provide opportunities to learn about distant places and people. Secondly, they enable communication with others online. Lastly, they are invaluable tools for students",0.903772694983803,0.9067237654738104
19,67,"The essay presents a clear and relevant thesis, emphasizing the balance between personal rights and the protection of youth in the context of censorship. The arguments are well-developed, supported with historical references and hypothetical scenarios that effectively illustrate the potential consequences of censorship. However, the essay would benefit from stronger real-world examples to enhance its persuasiveness. The organization is logical, with coherent transitions and well-defined topic sentences that guide the reader through the argument. The language and style are practical and appropriate, using suitable vocabulary and straightforward sentence structures that convey the intended message effectively. There is a smooth flow to the writing, although occasional awkward constructions could be refined for better readability. The essay demonstrates control over standard writing conventions, though minor errors in spelling and grammar are present and should be corrected to improve the overall quality. Overall, the essay is clear, practical, and relevant, aligning well with the teacher's values of clarity, practicality, real-world relevance, and linguistic precision.",67,"Your essay on censorship in libraries demonstrates a commendable effort to tackle a complex and nuanced issue. Your main ideas are clear, and your passion for the topic is evident. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to strengthen your argument and enhance the overall quality of your writing.

1. **Thesis Statement and Introduction**:
   - **Feedback**: Your thesis statement is somewhat buried within the introductory paragraph. It would be more effective if you explicitly state your stance on censorship early on. For example, ""Censorship in libraries should be opposed on the grounds of personal rights and historical consequences, except when it comes to protecting young and impressionable minds.""
   - **Suggestion**: Consider revising your introduction to clearly present your thesis statement, setting the stage for the arguments you will develop.

2. **Organization and Structure**:
   - **Feedback**: While your essay contains relevant points, the organization could be improved for better coherence. The transitions between paragraphs are sometimes abrupt, and the connection between ideas can be strengthened.
   - **Suggestion**: Use clear topic sentences at the beginning of each paragraph to guide the reader through your arguments. For example, ""One of the primary reasons censorship should be opposed is because it infringes on personal rights.""

3. **Supporting Arguments with Real-World Examples**:
   - **Feedback**: Your essay would benefit from more concrete real-world examples to support your points. While the hypothetical library scenario is effective, incorporating historical or contemporary examples would add depth to your argument.
   - **Suggestion**: Mention specific historical instances where censorship led to negative outcomes, such as book burnings in Nazi Germany or censorship in authoritarian regimes.

4. **Word Choice and Sentence Fluency**:
   - **Feedback**: Some of your word choices and phrases could be more precise. Also, ensure that your sentences flow smoothly to maintain the reader's interest.
   - **Suggestion**: Instead of ""if one person wants to censor something in a library,"" you could say, ""when individuals seek to censor materials in a library."" Additionally, revise sentences for clarity and conciseness. For example, ""History has shown that censorship often leads those in power down a dark road"" can be simplified to ""History demonstrates that censorship often results in the abuse of power.""

5. **Grammar, Spelling, and Punctuation**:
   - **Feedback**: There are several grammatical errors and misspellings that need to be addressed. For instance, ""perrogative"" should be ""prerogative,"" and ""ceratin"" should be ""certain.""
   - **Suggestion**: Carefully proofread your essay or use a spell-check tool to catch these errors. Additionally, consider reading your essay aloud to catch awkward phrasing or punctuation mistakes.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - **Feedback**: Your conclusion reiterates your main points but could be more compelling.
   - **Suggestion**: Strengthen your conclusion by","

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay you provided needs substantial improvement in several areas to meet the guidelines outlined by the teacher. The content of the essay is somewhat unclear and minimally developed; the arguments presented are not well-supported with real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning, making it difficult to understand the main points. The organization of the essay is weak, with ideas presented in a fragmented and disjointed manner. The lack of coherent transitions between sentences and paragraphs further disrupts the flow of the essay, making it hard for the reader to follow the argument. Word choice is poor, with numerous spelling errors and inappropriate vocabulary that detracts from the overall message. Sentence fluency is also lacking, with awkward constructions and repetitive phrasing that impede readability. Additionally, there are frequent grammatical errors, incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization issues that significantly distract the reader. To improve, the essay should focus on presenting a clear and relevant thesis statement, developing well-supported arguments with practical examples, and concluding effectively. Enhancing the organization with clear topic sentences and transitions, using appropriate and precise vocabulary, and adhering to standard writing conventions will also contribute to a higher quality essay.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: There should not be a certain kinds of books in the library. Books should not be tooken off the shelf just because some people find them offensive. Do not get the book, other people might like it, its just for entertainment.     If you do not like the book do not have to get the book. While looking for a book if there is one that does not seem right just look past. It will not even be a bother. There is a lot of books in the library, just find a different book instead of just focusing on that

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to address the topic of censorship in libraries; however, it lacks clarity and depth in its arguments. The main ideas are overly broad and repetitive, failing to engage the reader or provide strong support for the thesis. The essay's organization is weak, with a loose structure that lacks clear transitions and well-defined topic sentences, making it challenging to follow the author's train of thought. The word choice is often inappropriate and imprecise, using informal and incorrect terms such as ""tooken."" The sentence fluency is mechanical, with awkward constructions that impede readability. Furthermore, the essay contains several grammatical errors, including incorrect verb tense and punctuation issues, which detract from its overall effectiveness. To improve, the author should focus on developing a clear, concise thesis and supporting it with relevant, well-organized arguments and real-world examples. Additionally, attention should be given to refining sentence structure and word choice, as well as proofreading for grammatical accuracy.

left on the shelf for any of us."" --Katherine Paterson, Author

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Does censorship solve any problems?  If one person wants to censor something in a library, there is bound to be another person on the other side of that arguement  trying to protect that work from be taken away.  As a free country, it is every individuals right to take in whatever form of literature or music that they find pleasing, and history has shown the world that censorship leads those in power down a dark road.  The shielding of offensive materials is only necessary and fair when the young, impressionable minds of the world's youth are at stake, but once a person is old enough to make informed decisions, it should be their perrogative to choose their own material.  Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history, but necessary when protecting the young.     It is a person's right to choose what kind of literature they would like to read.  If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned.  For example take a hypothetical public library: a public library is an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music.  A great mental image of serenity and peace.  How does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves?  Suddenly right and left, books are disappearing as if by magic: a ceratin book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad.  Before long, there are not very many books left in this hypothetical library other than books for toddlers.  With this system, everyone suffers.  Everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to.  It would all just be simpler if book were just not banned from libraries.     History has given the world many a cruel dictator.  Oftentimes, once he comes to power, he is not the most popular of governmental forms.  To keep his subjects underneath his rule, often he has to resort to taking away civil rights.  This could be a curfew, fake elections, or censorship.  If the ruler has the power of censorship, he or she can control what the public thinks, feels, and believes.  With this power over them, the people are weakened and often abused.  Now imagine that censorship occuring in a country that has civil rights.  People would not stand for it.  So why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom?  There is absolutely no need for censorship to occur, and as history has shown, it certainly is not a good thing.     Censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights.  There is, however, one other element at play here: protection of youth and innocence.  Almost everyone can remember a time a child when they were young and innocent, free of worry and trouble.  That can disappear in a instant.  Children should not be exposed to things that are innappropriate for their age.  Nearly every movie nowadays has violent and risque, if not full-blown-adult, materials present in it.  The age of innocence is getting younger every generation, and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point.  A claim like this @MONTH1 sound hypotcritical coming from the mouth of one against censorship, but it is not 'censorship' when one is protecting the young.      Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children.  It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon.  The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people.  Also, children should be protected, and that is not censorship.  Censorship solves no problems, but it makes everyone unhappy.  Therefore, why censor
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","**Feedback:**

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Stance**: Your essay has a clear stance on the issue of censorship. You effectively argue against censorship while acknowledging the need to protect young, impressionable minds.
2. **Historical Context**: You provide historical context and examples to support your argument, which strengthens your position.
3. **Imagery and Examples**: The use of a hypothetical public library to illustrate your point is effective. It helps the reader visualize the consequences of censorship.
4. **Structure**: Your essay has a logical structure, with distinct sections for different points of your argument.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Spelling and Grammar**: There are several spelling and grammatical errors that need to be addressed. For example, ""arguement"" should be ""argument,"" ""perrogative"" should be ""prerogative,"" and ""ceratin"" should be ""certain.""
2. **Clarity and Conciseness**: Some sentences are a bit long and convoluted. Try to break them down into shorter, clearer sentences. For instance, ""If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned"" could be simplified for clarity.
3. **Consistency**: Ensure that your argument is consistent throughout. At times, the essay seems to waver, particularly in the section about protecting children. Clarify that while you oppose censorship for adults, you support age-appropriate restrictions for children.
4. **Transition and Flow**: Improve the transitions between paragraphs to ensure a smoother flow of ideas. Currently, some sections feel disjointed.
5. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion should be more definitive and concise. It currently feels a bit repetitive. Summarize your main points clearly and end with a strong statement.
6. **Error in Placeholder**: There is a placeholder ""@MONTH1"" that seems out of place and needs correction.

**Specific Suggestions:**
1. **Introduction**: Start with a more engaging hook to capture the reader's attention.
2. **Examples**: While your historical context is valuable, you could also include recent examples to make your argument more relatable to contemporary readers.
3. **Balancing Act**: While you argue against censorship, ensure you also emphasize the importance of diverse viewpoints and intellectual freedom.

**Revised Excerpt for Clarity:**
""Imagine a hypothetical public library: an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music. This serene image is shattered once books begin disappearing from the shelves.

20,70,"The essay demonstrates a minimal attempt at addressing the prompt, with several areas requiring significant improvement. The thesis and main ideas lack clarity and coherence, making it difficult for the reader to grasp the writer's central argument. The essay's content is underdeveloped, with few specific examples from Joe Kurmaskie's essay to support the points made. The language and spelling exhibit numerous errors, including incorrect word choices and grammatical mistakes, which detract from the overall readability and impact. Organizationally, the essay is disjointed, lacking clear transitions and well-defined topic sentences, resulting in a fragmented flow of ideas. The essay could benefit from a thorough revision to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness, ensuring that it adheres more closely to the prompt and includes well-supported, relevant examples from the memoir.",70,"Your essay attempts to address how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, which is a good start. However, there are several areas that need significant improvement to meet the expectations of clear, practical, and effective writing.

1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis is somewhat vague. Make sure to clearly state how the setting affects the cyclist in a concise manner at the beginning of your essay. For example, ""The harsh desert setting significantly impacts the cyclist by depleting his resources and challenging his endurance.""

2. **Supporting Evidence**: You have included some quotes from the text, which is good. However, they are not fully integrated into your argument. Be sure to explain how each example directly supports your point. For instance, when mentioning the ghost town, elaborate on how this contributes to the cyclist's sense of isolation and desperation.

3. **Organization and Coherence**: Your essay needs a more logical structure. Start with an introductory paragraph that includes a clear thesis statement. Follow with body paragraphs that each focus on a specific aspect of the setting and how it affects the cyclist. Use clear topic sentences to introduce each paragraph and ensure smooth transitions between ideas.

4. **Grammar, Spelling, and Punctuation**: There are numerous grammatical and spelling errors that detract from the readability of your essay. Errors such as ""Certin,"" ""desribes,"" ""he’s,"" ""difinition,"" ""scketle,"" ""untill,"" ""soluation,"" and ""sorching son"" need to be corrected. Always proofread your work or use tools to help identify and correct these mistakes.

5. **Vocabulary and Style**: Your language needs to be more precise and varied. Avoid repetitive phrasing and aim to use more sophisticated vocabulary where appropriate. For example, instead of ""maybe a little scketle at it,"" you could say ""somewhat skeptical.""

6. **Real-World Relevance**: While the essay is based on a fictional narrative, try to draw connections to real-world scenarios, emphasizing the practical implications of the cyclist's experience. This will strengthen your arguments and make your essay more impactful.

### Practical Suggestions for Improvement:
- **Revise your thesis** to make it clearer and more direct.
- **Integrate quotes more effectively** by explaining their relevance to your argument.
- **Structure your essay** with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion.
- **Proofread carefully** to fix grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors.
- **Enhance your vocabulary** to make your writing more engaging and precise.

By focusing on these areas, you can improve the clarity, coherence, and overall quality of your essay. Remember, writing is a process of continuous refinement and revision, so take the time to carefully revise your work. Keep striving for clear and effective communication in your writing.","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Rolling hills, open terran, hgh deserts-all are features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic response to the prompt by discussing how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, focusing on rolling hills, open terrain, and high deserts. However, it lacks depth and specificity in its supporting details, which limits the clarity and persuasiveness of the arguments. The writer uses some real-world examples but does not fully develop them to support their points effectively. The narrative follows a logical sequence, but transitions between ideas are somewhat abrupt, making the flow less smooth. While the language is generally clear and functional, it shows occasional errors in spelling and grammar, such as ""terran,"" ""hgh,"" and ""mles,"" which detract from the overall readability. Improving the essay would involve elaborating on the points with more detailed and specific examples, enhancing the transitions between ideas for better coherence, and carefully proofreading to correct grammatical errors.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay lacks clarity and practical relevance, making it difficult for the reader to follow the main points. The thesis is neither clear nor well-developed, leaving the intent and purpose of the essay ambiguous. The arguments are simplistic and not supported by real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning, which diminishes their impact. The conclusion is ineffective and fails to reinforce the thesis with practical implications. The organizational structure is weak, with ideas that are not coherently presented or logically connected through clear transitions and defined topic sentences. In terms of language and style, the essay employs a limited vocabulary, with word choices that are often inappropriate for the context, and sentence structures that are awkward and disjointed. The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which further impedes readability and detracts from the essay's overall quality. To improve, the essay needs a clear thesis, well-supported arguments with real-world examples, a logical structure with coherent transitions, appropriate and varied vocabulary, and meticulous attention to grammatical conventions.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The arhuror concludes this story with this paragraph to show people that the story or people in the story have a thing for nature or like writing about nature like whats in nature the change or maybe this story is about nature at its best.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is quite disorganized and lacks clarity and practical focus. The thesis is unclear, and the content is not developed with concrete, real-world evidence or pragmatic reasoning. The argument about the story and nature is repetitive and vague, leaving the reader without a clear understanding of the author's point. Additionally, the conclusion does not effectively reinforce the thesis or provide practical implications. Structurally, the essay falls short of the expected standards. It lacks a coherent organization, with no clear introduction, body, or conclusion. Transitions between ideas are absent, making the essay difficult to follow. The language and style used are inappropriate for the audience and purpose; there are numerous grammatical errors, misspellings, and issues with punctuation and capitalization. Words are often misused, which further obscures the intended meaning. Overall, the essay needs significant revision to improve clarity, practicality, structure, and adherence to standard writing conventions.

DOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit 
by Joe Kurmaskie 
FORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece 
of advice for the solo cyclist would be, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers 
who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” It’s not that a group of 
old guys doesn’t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid 
place. Things change. 
At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer 
evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn’t have done was 
let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice 
and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to 
Yosemite National Park. 
They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I 
would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with 
strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town.” 
This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time—say, before the last world war—but 
on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water 
supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool 
pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. 
Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, 
and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had 
been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of 
California in June. 
I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my 
strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the 
neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water 
wouldn’t cool down. It didn’t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. 
The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make 
that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so—a test of my inner spirit. 
Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was 
replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign 
jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. 
The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so 
cruel. 
I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it 
really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased 
past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. 
The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my 
shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June 
simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, 
caused me to laugh. 
It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. 
There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride 
down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d 
be fine. 
Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make 
sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst 
of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. 
In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building—abandoned years 
earlier, by the looks of it—had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A 
sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still 
be seen. 
I hung my head. 
That smoky blues tune “Summertime” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating 
brain. 
I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. 
I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you 
have left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. 
It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some 
expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and 
their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I 
was going to lose consciousness for the last time. 
Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining 
elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear 
were all behind me. 
GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP—IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE 
YOUR BEST BET! 
“And the only bet,” I remember thinking. 
As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an 
overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait—any bait, even 
though I didn’t own a rod or reel. 
An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from 
my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. 
“Where you headed in such a hurry?” 
“Yosemite,” I whispered. 
“Know the best way to get there?” 
I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group 
I’d listened to in Lodi. 
“Yes, sir! I own a very good map.” 
And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Certin features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes hes experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town. ''at first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little scketle at it because the old codgers  told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel. Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men.        
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Certainly! Here is the feedback based on the values of clarity, coherence, grammar, and content:

---

**Feedback:**

**1. Clarity and Coherence:** 
Your essay provides an interesting summary of Joe Kurmaskie's experience cycling through the desert. However, some parts of your essay could be clearer and more coherent. Try to connect your ideas more smoothly and provide a consistent flow of thought. For example, adding transition words and rephrasing certain sentences will help the reader follow your narrative better.

**2. Grammar and Spelling:**
There are several grammatical errors and misspelled words that need correction. Here are some specific points:
- ""Certin"" should be ""Certain.""
- ""desribes"" should be ""describes.""
- ""hes"" should be ""his.""
- ""difinition"" should be ""definition.""
- ""scketle"" should be ""skeptical.""
- ""untill"" should be ""until.""
- ""aroun"" should be ""around.""
- ""sorching son"" should be ""scorching sun.""
- ""soluation"" should be ""solace.""

**3. Sentence Structure:**
Some of your sentences are fragmented or awkwardly structured. For instance, instead of ""he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end,"" you might write, ""he still had a long way to go until he reached the park, and he felt as if the journey would never end."" This improves readability.

**4. Content:**
You have captured the essence of the cyclist’s experience well, but adding more detail and analysis would strengthen your essay. For example, why does the cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from the older men? How does the setting specifically impact his journey and mental state? Delving deeper into these aspects will make your essay more insightful.

**5. Quotations and References:**
When including quotes from the text, ensure they are correctly integrated and punctuated. For example, instead of ""...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town,"" you could write, ""He 'arrived at the first town' and noticed that 'it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.'""

**6. Formatting:**
Ensure your essay is properly formatted. Indenting paragraphs and using appropriate punctuation will enhance readability.

---

**Revised Example:**

Certain features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist. In Joe Kurmaskie's essay, he describes his experiences cycling through the desert. When he ""arrived at the first town,"" he noticed that ""it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" Initially, the cyclist found this amusing and perhaps was a bit skeptical because the older men had described it as thriving. Halfway through his journey, he stated, ""sometimes life can be so cruel."" With water running low and still a long way to go",0.8688501523418133,0.8860303251590247
21,71,"The essay demonstrates some effort to address how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, but it falls short in several critical areas. The thesis and overall argument are somewhat unclear, making it difficult to follow the main ideas. The essay does touch on various aspects of the setting, such as the sun, ghost towns, obstacles, and terrain, but these points are often presented without enough detail or real-world examples to support them effectively. Additionally, the essay lacks coherence and logical transitions between sentences and paragraphs, making it feel fragmented and disjointed. The language is imprecise, with numerous grammatical errors, awkward sentence constructions, and inappropriate word choices that detract from readability. These issues also impede the flow and make the narrative challenging to follow. Overall, the essay shows minimal control of standard writing conventions, and the frequent errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization further undermine the clarity and impact of the writing. To improve, the essay needs a clearer thesis, more detailed and well-supported arguments, better organization, and significant attention to language and grammar.",71,"**Feedback:**

Your essay touches on several key features of the setting that affect the cyclist, including the sun, ghost towns, obstacles, and terrain. You have identified these elements and attempted to explain their impacts on the cyclist, which is a good start. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved for clarity, organization, and coherence.

1. **Thesis Statement and Organization:**
   - Your essay needs a clear and concise thesis statement at the beginning to outline your main points and guide the reader through your arguments. For example, ""The cyclist’s journey is significantly impacted by the harsh sun, desolate ghost towns, various obstacles, and challenging terrain.""
   - Ensure each paragraph focuses on one main idea and includes a topic sentence to introduce that idea. This will help your essay flow more logically and make it easier to follow.

2. **Supporting Details and Real-World Examples:**
   - You have selected relevant details from the source text, but your explanations need to be more developed and specific. For example, when discussing the sun, you mention the cyclist becoming hot and thirsty, but you could elaborate on how this affects his physical condition and mental state.
   - When discussing the ghost towns, you should explain how the lack of water and supplies exacerbates the cyclist's sense of hopelessness and physical fatigue.

3. **Grammar, Spelling, and Punctuation:**
   - There are several grammatical errors and unclear phrases in your essay. For instance, ""thirsty-ness redufrom"" should be corrected to ""thirstiness reduced."" Additionally, ""ram-shackle sheds"" should be ""ramshackle sheds,"" and ""didn't have any watch for them to feel up with as he became dehydrated"" is unclear and should be revised.
   - Make sure to proofread your work to correct spelling errors, such as ""effect"" instead of ""affect"" and ""summer the hell"" instead of ""summit the hill.""

4. **Clarity and Practical Language:**
   - Use practical and straightforward language to express your ideas clearly. For example, ""The sun caused the cyclist to become extremely hot and thirsty, reducing his limited water supply and making the journey more challenging.""
   - Avoid repetitive phrases and ensure your sentences are clear and concise.

5. **Transitions and Coherence:**
   - Use transitional words and phrases to connect your ideas and create a smooth flow between paragraphs. Phrases like ""Moreover,"" ""Additionally,"" and ""Finally"" can help guide your reader through your arguments.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Your essay lacks a concluding paragraph that reinforces your thesis and summarizes the main points. Be sure to include a brief conclusion that ties everything together and reiterates how the setting's features affected the cyclist.

**Revised Example:**
""The cyclist's journey is significantly impacted by the harsh sun, desolate ghost towns, various obstacles, and challenging terrain. The intense heat from the sun made him","

simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, 
caused me to laugh. 
It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. 
There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride 
down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d 
be fine. 
Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make 
sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst 
of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. 
In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building—abandoned years 
earlier, by the looks of it—had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A 
sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still 
be seen. 
I hung my head. 
That smoky blues tune “Summertime” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating 
brain. 
I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. 
I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you 
have left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. 
It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some 
expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and 
their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I 
was going to lose consciousness for the last time. 
Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining 
elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear 
were all behind me. 
GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP—IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE 
YOUR BEST BET! 
“And the only bet,” I remember thinking. 
As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an 
overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait—any bait, even 
though I didn’t own a rod or reel. 
An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from 
my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. 
“Where you headed in such a hurry?” 
“Yosemite,” I whispered. 
“Know the best way to get there?” 
I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group 
I’d listened to in Lodi. 
“Yes, sir! I own a very good map.” 
And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.

TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for your effort in writing this essay. You've identified several key features in the setting that impact the cyclist, and your ideas show a clear understanding of how the environment can influence someone's experience. Here are some suggestions for improvement to help you refine your writing:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: Your essay would benefit from clearer and more coherent sentences. For instance, instead of ""THE SUN BEGINNING TO HEAT DOWN,"" you could say, ""The sun was beating down."" This makes your point clearer and more concise.

2. **Grammar and Sentence Structure**: Pay attention to grammar and sentence structure. For example, ""THE THIRSTY-NESS REDUFROM HIM TO USE HIS LIMITED SUPPLY OF WATER"" should be ""The thirst forced him to use his limited supply of water."" Additionally, ""ANOTHER FEATURE THAT CAUSED SOME PROBLEMS FOR THE CYCLIST WERE THE RUN DOWN GHOST TOWNS"" should be ""Another feature that caused problems for the cyclist was the run-down ghost towns.""

3. **Consistency in Tense**: Ensure that you maintain a consistent tense throughout your essay. For example, ""OBSTACLES SUCH AS TUMBLEWEEDS AND PAVEMENT BLOCKING SNAKES ALSO PLAYS"" should be ""Obstacles such as tumbleweeds and pavement-blocking snakes also played.""

4. **Detail and Explanation**: Some parts of your essay are unclear due to missing or incorrect words. For example, ""FEEL UP WITH AS HE BECAME DEHYDRATED"" could be rephrased to ""refill his water supply, leading to dehydration."" Ensure each sentence is complete and fully explains your point.

5. **Quotation Marks and Capitalization**: Use quotation marks and capitalization appropriately. For example, ""RUN DOWN GHOST TOWNS"" should be ""run-down 'ghost towns'."" Also, avoid using all caps, as it can be distracting.

6. **Conclusion**: Your last sentence appears incomplete: ""HE USES MUCH ENERGY TO SUMMER THE HELL, HE WAS ??? ???? ??? ???"" Make sure to complete your thoughts and provide a clear conclusion.

Revised Version:
The setting has several features that affect the cyclist in various ways. One feature is the sun beating down, which makes the cyclist hot and thirsty, forcing him to use his limited supply of water. The sun, therefore, impacts him both physically and resource-wise. Another problematic feature is the run-down ghost towns, consisting of ramshackle sheds and several rusty pumps. These sights lead the cyclist to feel hopeless, especially since there is no water available, causing dehydration. 

Obstacles such as tumbleweeds and pavement-blocking snakes also play a role in hindering the cyclist's progress on the road, making him slow down to just 12 mph. Finally, the terrain itself poses a significant challenge. A long, sloping",0.9478191011101941,0.9363875375623443
22,75,"The essay falls significantly short in addressing the prompt effectively. The thesis is unclear and the arguments are undeveloped, lacking any real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning to support the points being made. The conclusion is equally weak, failing to reinforce the thesis with any practical implications. The overall structure is disorganized, with no clear flow of ideas, coherent transitions, or well-defined topic sentences, making it difficult for the reader to follow the argument. The language used is imprecise and lacks variety, with numerous grammatical errors, incorrect spelling, and awkward sentence structures that impede readability. In essence, the essay requires substantial improvements in clarity, content, organization, and linguistic precision to meet the standards expected by the teacher.",75,"Your essay provides the basic idea of why the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph, but it lacks the depth and specificity needed to fully address the prompt. Here are a few areas for improvement:

1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis needs to be clearer and more specific. Instead of saying ""to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started,"" try to articulate what exactly Saeng hopes to achieve and how the blooming hibiscus symbolizes her personal growth and determination.

2. **Evidence and Examples**: While you quoted the last paragraph of the story, you need to incorporate more details and examples from the story to support your thesis. For instance, discuss how the hibiscus and other plants reminded Saeng of her childhood and her grandmother, and how this connection to her past fuels her determination to succeed in a new environment.

3. **Organization**: Your essay would benefit from a more structured approach. Start with an introduction that presents your thesis statement, followed by body paragraphs that support your thesis with specific evidence from the story. Conclude with a paragraph that reinforces your main points and ties them back to the thesis.

4. **Clarity and Grammar**: There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that need to be addressed. For example, ""when the hibiscus start to grow back"" should be ""when the hibiscus starts to grow back,"" and ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building"" should be ""when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is blooming.""

5. **Real-World Relevance**: Try to draw connections between Saeng’s experience and broader real-world themes related to resilience, adaptation, and personal growth. This will make your essay more practical and impactful.

Here's an example of how you might revise a portion of your essay to incorporate these suggestions:

**Revised Example**: 
""The author concludes the story with Saeng vowing to retake her driver’s test in the spring to symbolize her resilience and determination to adapt to her new life in America. When the hibiscus, a plant that holds deep personal significance for Saeng, begins to bloom again, it represents a renewal of hope and a connection to her cultural roots. Throughout the story, the hibiscus and other plants remind Saeng of her childhood in Vietnam and her grandmother, providing her with the emotional strength to face her challenges. By linking her decision to retake the test with the blooming of the hibiscus, the author emphasizes Saeng’s journey of growth and her commitment to overcoming obstacles.""

By focusing on these areas, you can create a more detailed, structured, and impactful essay that meets the criteria of the assignment. Keep up the effort, and continue to refine your writing to improve clarity and coherence.","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy.

So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is extremely difficult to understand due to its lack of clarity and coherence. The thesis is unclear and not relevant to any prompt, making it challenging for the reader to grasp the main idea or argument. The essay does not develop or support its arguments with real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning.

The language and word choice are inappropriate and inconsistent, and there are numerous grammatical errors, including problems with spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which significantly impede readability. Overall, the essay lacks clarity, practicality, real-world relevance, and linguistic precision, failing to meet the basic criteria of the guidelines provided.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The arhuror concludes this story with this paragraph to show people that the story or people in the story have a thing for nature or like writing about nature like whats in nature the change or maybe this story is about nature at its best.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is quite disorganized and lacks clarity and practical focus. The thesis is unclear, and the content is not developed with concrete, real-world evidence or pragmatic reasoning. The argument about the story and nature is repetitive and vague, leaving the reader without a clear understanding of the author's point.

The single sentence provided does not adequately introduce or conclude the topic, nor does it present a clear opinion or argument regarding the effects computers have on people or censorship in libraries. There are no real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning to support the writer’s stance, which significantly weakens the content.

DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus 
by Minfong Ho 
Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng
walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist
shop to see if the plant can be purchased. 
It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat
leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in
seemingly random profusion. 
“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy
potted plant by the corner. 
There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals
splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of
recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 
“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. 
A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with
vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into
the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the
bucket. 
Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,
oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had
not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. 
When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and
cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel. 
And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with
purplish petals and white centers. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced. How strange to
see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick
walls or between tiled roofs. 
And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and
found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.
“Dok Malik,” she said,
savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its
tag, “jasmine.” 
One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed
her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could
almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she
combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng
would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. 
Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm
around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed
comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? 
A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a
channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. 
And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. 
It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the
last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.
As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of
the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to
her. 
Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. “Ghup ma laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully.
“Goodness, it’s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?” Then she noticed
the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. 
Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. “Where
did you get it?” 
“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question. 
“How much?” 
For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. 
“That’s all?” Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the 
Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .” 
“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said. 
“Then what else—?” 
“Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” 
“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously. “But how could you? All the seeds for this
vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed
the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. 
“What happened?” she asked, more gently. 
“I—I failed the test,” Saeng said. 
For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the
eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. 
Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng’s hands. “It’s a beautiful
plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.” 
“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. 
“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the
words at home, lest she burst into tears again. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said. 
“I know,” her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t
as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.
That’s what matters.” 
She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her
other hand. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said. “Let’s plant it, right now.” 
She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The
soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair
trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There
was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. 
“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. 
Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and
start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?” 
“I’d love it,” Saeng said. 
Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.
She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,
the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth
watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not
even Mrs. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.
But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. 
The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.
Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng
now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange
before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her
now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against
the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. 
When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the
geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started. I think that is why because she says In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay. Here are some observations and suggestions to help improve your writing:

1. **Clarify Your Thesis**: Your concluding statement provides an interpretation of the story, which is a great start. However, it would be beneficial to clearly state your thesis at the beginning of your essay. This will help set the stage for your analysis and make your argument more coherent.

2. **Quotation Integration**: When you include a quote from the text, make sure to integrate it smoothly into your own writing. Currently, the quote feels somewhat separate from your analysis. You can frame it more effectively by introducing the quote and explaining its significance in your own words.

3. **Grammar and Syntax**: There are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrases, such as ""The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say..."" and “I think that is why because she says..."" Rephrasing these sentences will enhance readability. For instance, you could say, ""I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate that...""

4. **Be Specific**: It's important to be clear and specific in your analysis. Instead of saying ""I think,” you could use more assertive language like ""The author intends to convey…” This will make your argument stronger and more persuasive.

5. **Expand Your Analysis**: While your essay touches on the conclusion of the story, expanding your analysis to include more details and examples from the text will strengthen your argument. Try to explain why the return of the hibiscus and the changing seasons are significant symbols in the context of the story.

6. **Proofread**: Finally, always proofread your work for spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors. This will ensure that your writing is polished and professional.

Here's a revised version of your paragraph to illustrate these points:

""The author concludes the story with the final paragraph to illustrate the cyclical nature of the protagonist's journey. When the hibiscus starts to grow back, it symbolizes a return to the beginning, suggesting that the protagonist will have another opportunity to face her challenges. This is evident when she states, 'In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.' This line indicates that the protagonist is hopeful and ready to confront her trials once more, highlighting the themes of resilience and renewal.""

While the author attempts to conclude the story by highlighting Saeng's resolve to retake a failed test, the reasoning behind this resolution is not well-developed or supported by specific details from the text. The essay does not adhere closely to the prompt and provides minimal relevant information from the story. Language issues, such as grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures, impede readability and detract from the overall coherence of the essay. The narrative is disjointed and fails to engage the reader, showing a need for better organization and more effective use of transitional elements. To improve, the writer should focus on developing a clear thesis, providing specific examples from the text, and ensuring grammatical accuracy for better readability.",77,"Thank you for your submission. You've started to capture the essence of Saeng's emotional journey, which is pivotal to understanding the story's conclusion. Here are some specific areas for improvement to enhance clarity, organization, and effectiveness:

1. **Clear Thesis Statement**:
   - Your response would benefit from a more explicit thesis statement that directly answers the prompt. For example, ""The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's growing sense of familiarity and hope in her new environment, symbolized by her resolve to retake the test in the spring.""

2. **Use of Real-World Examples**:
   - While you've touched on Saeng finding something that reminds her of her previous life, providing specific examples from the text will strengthen your argument. Mentioning the hibiscus plant and its significance to Saeng would add depth. For instance, ""The hibiscus plant reminds Saeng of her home in Vietnam, providing her with a sense of continuity and comfort in her new life.""

3. **Logical Organization**:
   - Your response needs better structure to guide the reader through your argument. Consider breaking it into distinct parts: introduction (with thesis statement), body (with supporting examples), and conclusion. This will help maintain a clear and coherent flow.

4. **Detailed Supporting Evidence**:
   - Incorporate more details from the story to support your points. Discuss how the sight of familiar plants triggers memories of Saeng's grandmother and her past life, which helps her feel more at home and confident about her future.

5. **Language and Grammar**:
   - There are several grammatical errors that need attention. Ensure you use correct punctuation and complete sentences. For instance, ""now that she's found something that reminds her"" should be ""now that she has found something that reminds her.""

6. **Practical Suggestions for Improvement**:
   - Revise your current sentence to be more detailed and grammatically correct. For example: ""The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng, having found a hibiscus plant that reminds her of her old home, feels a renewed sense of hope and determination. This newfound connection to her past gives her the strength to retake the driving test in the spring, symbolizing her gradual adaptation to her new life.""

Here’s a revised version of your paragraph incorporating these suggestions:

""The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's growing sense of familiarity and hope in her new environment. Finding the hibiscus plant, which reminds her of her life in Vietnam, provides her with a comforting connection to her past. This symbol of continuity gives Saeng the confidence to vow to retake the driving test in the spring, reflecting her gradual adaptation and determination to succeed in her new life.""

Keep practicing and refining your writing. With attention to detail and structure, your arguments will become clearer and more persuasive. Good job identifying the key elements of the story, and I look forward to seeing your improved drafts.","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concude the story with that paragraph because its what she solemely promoted herself.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Upon reviewing the provided essay, it is evident that it lacks clarity, organization, and depth. The thesis statement is almost non-existent, and there is a lack of coherent development and support for any argument. The single sentence provided does not adequately introduce or conclude the topic, nor does it present a clear opinion or argument regarding the effects computers have on people or censorship in libraries. There are no real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning to support the writer’s stance, which significantly weakens the content. Additionally, the sentence structure is awkward, with grammatical errors that hinder readability. The absence of transitional phrases and logical flow makes the essay difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on developing a clear thesis, supporting arguments with concrete examples, and ensuring grammatical accuracy while maintaining a structured and coherent narrative.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is extremely difficult to understand due to its lack of clarity and coherence. The thesis is unclear and not relevant to any prompt, making it challenging for the reader to grasp the main idea or argument. The essay does not develop or support its arguments with real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning. Moreover, the structure of the essay is disorganized, with no clear introduction, body, or conclusion, and transitions between ideas are either nonexistent or very awkward. The language and word choice are inappropriate and inconsistent, and there are numerous grammatical errors, including problems with spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which significantly impede readability. Overall, the essay lacks clarity, practicality, real-world relevance, and linguistic precision, failing to meet the basic criteria of the guidelines provided. Improvements in content development, organization, language, and adherence to the prompt are necessary for a higher evaluation.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay lacks clarity and practical relevance, making it difficult for the reader to follow the main points. The thesis is neither clear nor well-developed, leaving the intent and purpose of the essay ambiguous. The arguments are simplistic and not supported by real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning, which diminishes their impact. The conclusion is ineffective and fails to reinforce the thesis with practical implications. The organizational structure is weak, with ideas that are not coherently presented or logically connected through clear transitions and defined topic sentences. In terms of language and style, the essay employs a limited vocabulary, with word choices that are often inappropriate for the context, and sentence structures that are awkward and disjointed. The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which further impedes readability and detracts from the essay's overall quality. To improve, the essay needs a clear thesis, well-supported arguments with real-world examples, a logical structure with coherent transitions, appropriate and varied vocabulary, and meticulous attention to grammatical conventions.

DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus 
by Minfong Ho 
Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng
walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist
shop to see if the plant can be purchased. 
It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat
leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in
seemingly random profusion. 
“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy
potted plant by the corner. 
There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals
splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of
recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 
“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. 
A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with
vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into
the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the
bucket. 
Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,
oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had
not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. 
When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and
cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel. 
And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with
purplish petals and white centers. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced. How strange to
see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick
walls or between tiled roofs. 
And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and
found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.
“Dok Malik,” she said,
savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its
tag, “jasmine.” 
One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed
her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could
almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she
combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng
would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. 
Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm
around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed
comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? 
A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a
channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. 
And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. 
It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the
last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.
As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of
the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to
her. 
Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. “Ghup ma laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully.
“Goodness, it’s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?” Then she noticed
the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. 
Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. “Where
did you get it?” 
“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question. 
“How much?” 
For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. 
“That’s all?” Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the 
Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .” 
“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said. 
“Then what else—?” 
“Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” 
“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously. “But how could you? All the seeds for this
vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed
the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. 
“What happened?” she asked, more gently. 
“I—I failed the test,” Saeng said. 
For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the
eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. 
Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng’s hands. “It’s a beautiful
plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.” 
“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. 
“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the
words at home, lest she burst into tears again. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said. 
“I know,” her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t
as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.
That’s what matters.” 
She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her
other hand. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said. “Let’s plant it, right now.” 
She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The
soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair
trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There
was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. 
“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. 
Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and
start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?” 
“I’d love it,” Saeng said. 
Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.
She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,
the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth
watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not
even Mrs. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.
But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. 
The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.
Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng
now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange
before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her
now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against
the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. 
When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the
geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is by herself, and letting herself know that she is going to try the test she failed again because she is starting to get used to her new home now that shes found something that reminds her of her life before she left.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay! Here are some constructive points to help you enhance your writing further:

1. **Clarity and Structure**: Your paragraph conveys the key idea, but it could benefit from clearer structure and more detail. Try to break down your thoughts into smaller, more digestible sentences. This will help your reader follow your argument more easily.

2. **Grammar and Mechanics**: Pay attention to punctuation and grammar. For instance, ""shes"" should be ""she's."" Also, consider breaking the long sentence into two or three shorter ones to enhance readability.

3. **Specificity**: You mention that Saeng found something that reminds her of her past, but you don't specify what that is. Adding this detail would make your conclusion stronger and more vivid.

4. **Depth of Analysis**: Expand on why the reminder of her past is significant for Saeng. How does it help her feel more at home? What does this suggest about her character or the broader themes of the story?

5. **Engagement**: Your concluding sentence should leave a lasting impression. Consider rephrasing to make it more impactful, perhaps by highlighting Saeng's growth or newfound determination.

Here's a revised version incorporating these points:

""The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's journey toward resilience and adaptation. Alone and introspective, Saeng resolves to retake the test she previously failed, symbolizing her growing comfort in her new environment. This shift occurs as she discovers an element that connects her to her past life, a reminder that bridges her old and new worlds. This discovery not only fosters a sense of belonging but also reignites her determination to succeed, highlighting her inner strength and the theme of perseverance throughout the narrative.""

Keep up the great effort, and continue to refine your writing skills!",0.9033806655009561,0.9119406127455827
24,81,"The essay demonstrates a commendable effort in capturing the essence of Narciso Rodriguez's reflections on his home and family. The author successfully conveys the heartwarming and appreciative tone that Rodriguez created, specifically highlighting the sense of comfort and unity within his family environment. However, the essay could benefit from a clearer and more relevant thesis statement to guide the reader. The arguments should be more practical and supported with direct, real-world examples from the memoir to strengthen the case. The conclusion does a reasonable job of reinforcing the thesis but could emphasize practical implications more effectively. The organization of the essay is generally clear, with coherent transitions and well-defined topic sentences, although there are moments where the structure could be tighter. Language use is decent, but several grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and some awkward phrasing detract from the overall clarity and precision. Improving these elements would enhance the essay's readability and effectiveness. Overall, the essay is interesting and generally maintains a smooth narrative flow, but it could be more engaging with better transitional elements and stronger linkage between points.",81,"Your essay effectively identifies the heartwarming and appreciative mood of the memoir. However, there are several areas for improvement to better align with the assignment guidelines and enhance your overall writing clarity and coherence.

1. **Thesis Statement**: Your essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement. A strong thesis would help guide your analysis and provide a clear focus for your essay. Consider revising your introductory sentence to clearly state the mood created by the author and briefly outline the key points you will discuss.

2. **Supporting Evidence**: While you have referenced the memoir, your use of quotes and specific examples could be more detailed and better integrated into your analysis. For instance, when you mention the sense of family and appreciation, provide more context from the memoir to support these observations. Explain how specific passages contribute to the overall mood.

   - Example: ""Rodriguez illustrates the warmth of his home by describing the lively kitchen, where 'the aromas of the kitchen' and 'passionate Cuban music' created an inviting atmosphere.""

3. **Organization and Coherence**: Your essay would benefit from a more logical flow and clearer transitions between ideas. Ensure each paragraph focuses on a single point that supports your thesis, using well-defined topic sentences and smooth transitions.

4. **Grammar and Clarity**: There are several grammatical errors and misspellings that need correction to improve readability. Pay attention to spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure.

   - Corrected Example: ""Home and family are the most important things to all of us. The author creates a heartwarming and appreciative mood by illustrating how comfortable and joyful his home was with everyone together.""

5. **Vocabulary and Precision**: Use precise and varied vocabulary to avoid repetition and enhance your writing. Ensure that your language clearly conveys your analysis and observations.

6. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion should effectively summarize your main points and reinforce the mood identified in the memoir. Make sure it ties back to your thesis and leaves the reader with a clear understanding of your analysis.

   - Example: ""In conclusion, Rodriguez's memoir creates a heartwarming and appreciative mood through vivid descriptions of his home life and the sacrifices his parents made. The memoir highlights the importance of family, not just by blood, but through shared experiences and love.""

By focusing on these areas, you can strengthen your analysis and produce a more coherent and compelling essay. Keep working on integrating detailed real-world examples, improving your grammar, and ensuring a logical flow to enhance the overall quality of your writing.","

My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a 
furnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old 
Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon 
call home. 
In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the 
Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our 
traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared 
cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking 
that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which 
I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of 
childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed 
both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. 
Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that “family” had nothing to do with 
being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, 
Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation 
prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these 
cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of 
honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their 
own kind, were clearly in need. 
Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and 
Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio 
and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not 
know my “real” grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were 
allowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and 
Rosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family 
members came and went — and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they 
were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the 
many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. 
My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the 
language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a 
better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country 
they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters 
while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were 
strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind 
of jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had 
studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, 
taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their 
children to better times drove them to endure these hard times. 
I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I’ve often told them that what 
they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I’ve often told them of 
my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I’ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in 
reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at 
such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two 
lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these 
teachings have been the basis of my life. 
It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to 
this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this 
humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not 
just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of “family.” 
And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I 
learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into 
a home.

TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay on the theme of home and family. You have chosen a heartfelt topic that resonates with many people, and you conveyed some meaningful insights. Here are some suggestions to help you improve your essay:

1. **Clarity and Structure**:
   - Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Start with an introduction that outlines what you will discuss. Follow with body paragraphs that each focus on a specific point, and conclude with a summary that ties everything together.
   - For example, you can start with a sentence introducing the author and the main theme of their work, then move on to discussing specific aspects like the mood, the environment, and the sense of family.

2. **Grammar and Spelling**:
   - Pay attention to spelling and grammar. There are a few errors that need correction, such as ""comftable"" (comfortable), ""enviroment"" (environment), ""familly"" (family), ""wiched"" (which), ""deseverd"" (deserved).
   - Also, ensure that punctuation is used correctly. For instance, use commas and periods to separate sentences clearly and make your writing easier to read.

3. **Quotations and Citations**:
   - When you use quotations, integrate them smoothly into your sentences and make sure they are accurate. For example: Growing up in this environment instilled in him a great sense that ""family"" has nothing to do with being a blood relative.
   - Cite the source properly if there is a specific reference you are drawing from.

4. **Expression and Vocabulary**:
   - Aim to use a varied vocabulary to make your writing more engaging. Instead of repeating words like ""appreciation"" and ""together,"" try using synonyms or rephrasing your sentences.
   - For example, instead of ""Narciso Rodriguez show his appreciation,"" you might say, ""Narciso Rodriguez demonstrates his gratitude.""

5. **Content and Analysis**:
   - Your essay touches upon important points but needs deeper analysis. Explain why the author's appreciation for his home and family is significant. How does it impact him or his life?
   - Discuss the themes and emotions more thoroughly. For example, you mentioned bravery—expand on this by exploring what sacrifices were made and why they were important.

Here’s a revised version of your opening to illustrate these suggestions:

---

""Home and family are fundamental aspects that all of us cherish. The author creates a heartwarming and appreciative mood by describing the comfortable atmosphere of his home, where everyone enjoys time together. He emphasizes that being a family is not just about being blood relatives. Narciso Rodriguez shows his deep appreciation for his parents, who made significant sacrifices to provide him with a better life, even though it meant leaving their own families behind. This brave decision highlights the strength and love that define his sense of home. Through his narrative, the author expresses his gratitude for both his parents and his Hispanic heritage.""

Overall, the essay showcases a high degree of originality, creative expression, and effective communication.",88,"Your essay presents a strong argument against censorship in libraries and other media, bolstered by well-chosen examples and logical reasoning. Your stance is clear and well-articulated, reflecting a deep understanding of the complexities surrounding censorship.

**Strengths:**
1. **Originality and Creativity:** Your essay showcases an original and creative approach to the topic, particularly in how you draw parallels between books, movies, and music. This comparative method effectively highlights the overarching issue of censorship across different media.

Careful proofreading can help eliminate these distractions. Additionally, correcting placeholders like ""@CAPS1"" and ""@CAPS2"" will improve readability.
3. **Sentence Fluency:** Some sentences are a bit lengthy and could be broken down for better readability. For instance, ""Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a @CAPS15 nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong"" could be made more concise.
4. **Stronger Conclusion:** Your conclusion effectively reiterates your main points but could be strengthened by offering a more innovative perspective or a call to action. This would leave a more lasting impression on the reader.

**Suggestions:**
- **Transitions:** To enhance coherence, consider using transitional phrases like ""Moreover,"" ""In addition,"" or ""On the other hand"" to guide your reader through your points smoothly.
- **Proofreading:** Allocate time to review your essay for minor errors. Reading aloud can often help identify awkward phrasing or mistakes that might be overlooked when reading silently.
- **Expanding Ideas:** Provide a bit more explanation for some of your points. For example, when discussing the historical context of offensive language, delve deeper into why understanding this context is crucial for modern readers.

Overall, your essay demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and reflects your unique voice and creativity. With some refinement in organization and attention to detail in grammar and spelling, your argument will be even more compelling. Keep pushing the boundaries of your expression and continue to explore new ideas confidently. Excellent work!","

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: If there is an offensive book or a bad @CAPS2 and someone doesn't like it and feels the need to remove it, that is @CAPS3 but then they aren't thinking of what other people might like.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Most modern day book, movies, music, etc. do a fairly good job of placing warning in the form of '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticks on their covers. But books from before this practice began to happen @MONTH1 be found more offensive then books today. Why? Well, that's because many books of the past use words that today are found offensive. But those books, movies, and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem. There are examples of how each catagory is in today's society.     Take the book 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', written by @PERSON1, for example. In that story, there are words that are used to describe people of that time.. Back when @PERSON1 wrote the book, it was perfectly fine to use those words on those people, but in today's modern world, that is a book that has been on the list for being banned. It is offensive to use that word on people today, so parent groups and others are trying to get that book pulled off of shelves in hopes of erasing what was done in the past. I don't believe that a book should be banned for it's content, but rather how well it teaches its reader through its words. If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and the culture of that time, then it shouldn't be banned at all. It should be read.     Movies have a rating system for a reason. There are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience. People must be of a certain age to rent, buy, or view these kind of movies 'leagally'. Not too many people listen to that system, even though it has exsisted for years. A horror film is not suitable for a @CAPS15 of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on @CAPS4. Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a @CAPS15 nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong. That is the fault of the parents. They were the ones who let their @CAPS15 watch that movie in the first place. So the movie shouldn't be held responsible for the @CAPS15. If the movie was intended for a more mature audience, that's the way it should stay.     And that brings us to music. There is a lot of music in today's age that can be considered very offensive. There are only a few 'pure' genres, free of the cursing that is used in many of the others today. But children, teen, and adults all find their favorite kind, and you can't change their minds then. The governement has issued that all music containing harsh words, horrid images to the mind, gruesome scenes, and other elements that are offensive to people, must carry a sticker on it. The black and white '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticker. When parents see this sticker on the @CAPS7, @NUM1 download, or whatever their @CAPS15 is using, then they know that it is more than likely not right for their @CAPS15 to listen to. Doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it means that there is a slight chance that their minds will not be tainted by 'garbage'.     So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't neccessarily mean that it is the same to another person. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society. People will still argue that books such as 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON2', '@CAPS10 in the @CAPS11', and many, many more books like them should be banned. They will always fight that movies such as 'A @CAPS12 on @CAPS13 @CAPS14,' '@DATE1 the @NUM2', or '@CAPS15's @CAPS16' should be removed from store shelves because it gave them nightmares as a @CAPS19 or it gives their @CAPS15 nightmares because they saw it. And they will always try to fight and say that artist like @CAPS17' @CAPS18, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS19 @CAPS20 are not suited for their @CAPS15. Well, this pattern has been going on for years. Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for a adult audience, not for a @CAPS15 of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue about what should be on shelves and what should not, remember that it might be that parent's fault for letting their @CAPS15 view it in the first place.

FEEDBACK: 
","### Feedback:

#### Content and Argumentation:
1. **Thesis Statement**: Your essay presents a clear stance on the issue of censoring books, movies, and music. However, the thesis could be more explicitly stated at the beginning to guide the reader through your argument.

2. **Supporting Evidence**: You provide examples from books and movies, but these examples are not fully developed. It would be beneficial to elaborate on specific instances and how they illustrate your point. For example, instead of using placeholders like '@CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', provide real titles and authors to strengthen your argument.

3. **Logical Flow**: Your points on books, movies, and music are somewhat disjointed. Consider using clearer topic sentences and transitions to improve the coherence of your essay.

#### Structure and Organization:
1. **Paragraph Structure**: Each paragraph should start with a clear topic sentence that outlines the main idea. Ensure that all sentences within the paragraph support the topic sentence and contribute to the overall argument.

2. **Conclusion**: The conclusion reiterates your main points well, but it could be more concise. Focus on summarizing your key arguments and reinforcing your thesis.

#### Language and Grammar:
1. **Word Choice**: Be mindful of the words you choose. For example, ""leagally"" should be ""legally,"" and ""exsisted"" should be ""existed."" Proofreading your work can help catch these errors.

2. **Clarity**: Some sentences are confusing due to poor word choice or structure. For instance, ""But books from before this practice began to happen @MONTH1 be found more offensive then books today"" is unclear. Ensure each sentence clearly conveys your intended meaning.

3. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are multiple grammatical errors, such as ""it's"" instead of ""its,"" ""catagory"" instead of ""category,"" and ""neccessarily"" instead of ""necessarily."" These mistakes can distract from your argument and should be corrected.

#### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Develop Examples**: Replace placeholders with real examples and elaborate on them to strengthen your argument.
2. **Proofread**: Carefully proofread your essay to correct grammatical and spelling errors.
3. **Transitional Phrases**: Use transitional phrases to improve the flow of your argument between paragraphs.
4. **Conciseness**: Be more concise, especially in your conclusion, to ensure your main points are clear and impactful.

Overall, your essay addresses an important issue and presents a clear stance. With more detailed examples, improved coherence, and careful proofreading, your writing will be much stronger. Keep up the good work and continue to refine your skills!",0.9424529279575691,0.9288004172667581
26,91,"The essay effectively addresses the setting's impact on the cyclist, using specific examples to illustrate how various features, such as the hills, the road signs, and the abandoned grape juice factory, contribute to his challenges and eventual relief. However, the response could benefit from deeper analysis and more detailed exploration of these elements to fully capture their significance. The language is clear, and there is a basic structure in place, but the essay would be more engaging with varied vocabulary and sentence structures. The transitions between ideas are present but could be smoother to enhance the overall flow. Additionally, while the essay stays on topic, there are moments where it could delve deeper into the cyclist's emotional and physical journey to provide a richer narrative. Overall, the response is cohesive and understandable, but it could be more compelling with more vivid language and a more thorough examination of the setting’s effects on the cyclist.",91,"Your essay does a commendable job of identifying specific features of the setting in ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" and explaining how they affect the cyclist. I particularly appreciate how you noted the hills, the road sign, and the grape juice advertisement, as these illustrate the challenges and ironies the cyclist faced quite effectively.

**Strengths:**
1. **Specific Examples:** You provided concrete examples from the text, which helps anchor your analysis and makes your argument more compelling.
2. **Clear Structure:** Your essay has a clear structure, guiding the reader through the different aspects of the setting that affected the cyclist.
3. **Engaging Language:** The use of phrases like ""exasperated the cyclist"" and ""sadistic irony"" adds a level of engagement and shows an effort to use varied vocabulary.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Depth of Analysis:** While you mentioned several features that affect the cyclist, some of your points could benefit from deeper exploration. For instance, consider elaborating on how the hills specifically impacted his physical and mental endurance. How did the ""water-depleting"" pace affect his overall journey?
2. **Integration of Quotes:** When integrating quotes, aim for a smoother transition and ensure they enhance your argument. The quote about the speed limit, for example, could be more seamlessly woven into your analysis to highlight how the cyclist's slow pace contributed to his frustration and exhaustion.
3. **Conclusion:** Your concluding sentence could be more impactful and reflective. Perhaps summarize how these negative experiences contributed to the cyclist’s growth or his overall journey, tying back to the main theme of perseverance and resilience.

**Grammatical and Stylistic Notes:**
1. **Use of Vocabulary:** You have a good command of vocabulary, but there's room to incorporate even more varied and imaginative language to make your essay more vibrant.
2. **Minor Errors:** Be mindful of minor grammatical errors, such as ""exasperated"" instead of ""exacerbated."" Proofreading your essay can help catch these small mistakes.

**Overall:**
Your essay is clear and well-organized, with solid evidence from the text to support your points. By delving deeper into your analysis and refining the integration of quotes, you can elevate the originality and depth of your response, fully aligning with our class’s emphasis on creative expression and originality.

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to discuss the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the story. The ideas are underdeveloped and the content is minimal, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the intended message. There is a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points being made, which weakens the overall argument. The response also tends to wander off-topic and does not adhere closely to the prompt. The language used is simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors, such as ""shes"" instead of ""she's"" and ""sentance"" instead of ""sentence."" These errors distract from the readability of the essay and hinder its effectiveness. Additionally, the essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes the narrative difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing detailed support from the story, maintaining clarity in addressing the prompt, enhancing vocabulary, and ensuring a smooth flow of ideas with proper transitions.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: According to @PERSON1, economic @CAPS1, every hour you spend on the computer, you raise your electricity bill by @MONEY2. The average @CAPS2 spends @NUM1 hours on the computer everyday. I believe that spending too much time on the computer could be a bad thing. You have economic loss from the electric bill, health loss because you won't be able to exercise as much, and community less because you won't spen as much with your community. Financial loss is something that many people are concerned

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and focused argument against excessive computer use, supported by recognizable main ideas: financial loss, health issues, and community disintegration. The originality of the thesis could be improved by providing a more unique or thought-provoking perspective on the topic. The essay is satisfactorily organized, with a basic introduction, body, and conclusion, though the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow of ideas. The word choice effectively conveys the intended message, but there is room for more varied and imaginative language to make the essay more engaging. The sentences generally flow well, though some constructions could be more fluid and varied to maintain the reader’s interest. The essay demonstrates control of standard writing conventions, but there are noticeable errors in spelling and grammar that slightly impede readability. Overall, the essay is clear and persuasive but could benefit from more creative expression and polished language use to fully align with the teacher's emphasis on originality and creative expression.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: loss there is also a health issue. Many people are talking about how americans are becoming obise. Part @MONEY1 this is due to spending too much time on the computer. Proffesor @CAPS3 @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 says that, ""the obisety in @LOCATION1 is a problem, if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, that problem would be solved."" @CAPS4, @NUM5 out @MONEY1 @NUM6 people are obese. If everyone spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, it would become @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM6.

DOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit 
by Joe Kurmaskie 
FORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece 
of advice for the solo cyclist would be, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers 
who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” It’s not that a group of 
old guys doesn’t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid 
place. Things change. 
At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer 
evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn’t have done was 
let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice 
and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to 
Yosemite National Park. 
They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I 
would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with 
strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town.” 
This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time—say, before the last world war—but 
on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water 
supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool 
pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. 
Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, 
and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had 
been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of 
California in June. 
I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my 
strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the 
neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water 
wouldn’t cool down. It didn’t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. 
The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make 
that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so—a test of my inner spirit. 
Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was 
replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign 
jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. 
The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so 
cruel. 
I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it 
really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased 
past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. 
The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my 
shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June 
simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, 
caused me to laugh. 
It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. 
There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride 
down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d 
be fine. 
Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make 
sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst 
of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. 
In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building—abandoned years 
earlier, by the looks of it—had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A 
sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still 
be seen. 
I hung my head. 
That smoky blues tune “Summertime” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating 
brain. 
I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. 
I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you 
have left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. 
It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some 
expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and 
their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I 
was going to lose consciousness for the last time. 
Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining 
elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear 
were all behind me. 
GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP—IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE 
YOUR BEST BET! 
“And the only bet,” I remember thinking. 
As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an 
overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait—any bait, even 
though I didn’t own a rod or reel. 
An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from 
my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. 
“Where you headed in such a hurry?” 
“Yosemite,” I whispered. 
“Know the best way to get there?” 
I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group 
I’d listened to in Lodi. 
“Yes, sir! I own a very good map.” 
And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: In the essay, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit there are many features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. Many of these features affect him in a negative way. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist. I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait. All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.

1. **Introduction and Conclusion:**
   - **Introduction:** Your essay could benefit from a more robust introduction that provides context for the reader and states the thesis clearly. For example, you could introduce the essay's main themes and how the setting influences the cyclist's journey.
   - **Conclusion:** While you do summarize the main points, try to restate the thesis in a way that encapsulates the overall impact of the setting on the cyclist, offering a final reflection or insight.

2. **Clarity and Specificity:**
   - **Details:** When you mention certain features, such as the ""hills"" and the ""sun,"" try to be more specific about how they affect the cyclist. For example, ""The steep hills and the relentless sun significantly drained the cyclist's energy and morale.""
   - **Quotes:** Integrate quotes more smoothly into your sentences. For example, instead of ""The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2,"" you could say, “The cyclist struggled to maintain speed, noting the irony in the ‘Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit’ sign as he could barely pedal at @NUM2 mph.”

3. **Grammar and Word Choice:**
   - **Exasperated vs. Exacerbated:** Use ""exacerbated"" instead of ""exasperated"" in the context of worsening the cyclist's condition.
   - **Word Choice:** Avoid repetitive phrases like ""probably felt"" and ""probably made him feel."" They can be replaced with more assertive language to convey the impact more confidently.

4. **Flow and Coherence:**
   - **Transitions:** Ensure that your essay flows smoothly from one point to the next. For instance, you can use transitional phrases like ""Furthermore,"" ""In addition,"" and ""Moreover"" to connect your ideas better.

5. **Analysis and Insight:**
   - **Deeper Analysis:** Offer deeper analysis on how the setting elements relate to the overall theme or message of the essay. For example, discuss how the setting’s challenges might symbolize broader life challenges and the cyclist’s resilience.

Here's a revised example of a section from your essay:

**Original:** ""Another feature was the road sign that said 'Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit' 'The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.' The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it.""

**Revised:** ""Another challenging feature of the setting was the road sign that read 'Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit",0.9188890643066567,0.8919464921182483
27,92,"The essay lacks clarity, structure, and strong content, making it difficult to engage with and understand. The thesis statement is vague and lacks originality, failing to present a unique or thought-provoking idea about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The essay does not develop supporting arguments creatively, and the conclusion is ineffective and fails to provide a fresh perspective. The organization is disjointed, with a lack of clear flow and smooth transitions between ideas, leading to a confusing and fragmented narrative. The language and style are monotonous, with a limited vocabulary and repetitive sentence structures that do not captivate the reader. Additionally, the essay contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that further detract from its readability. Overall, the essay does not meet the standards for originality, creative expression, or imaginative language use as outlined in the guidelines.",92,"Your essay provides a good starting point in exploring how the features of the setting affect the cyclist during his journey. You’ve identified various elements like the road conditions, the presence of rocks, and potential encounters with snakes, which are all relevant to the cyclist's experience. This shows that you have a clear understanding of the text and its setting, which is a strong foundation.

However, to enhance your essay and make it more engaging, here are a few suggestions:

1. **Expand Your Examples**: While you’ve mentioned some features like the road and rocks, it would be beneficial to delve deeper into specific examples from the text. For instance, you could describe how the cyclist's water supply depleting in the high desert affected his journey, or how the abandoned Welch’s Grape Juice factory he encountered added to his despair.

2. **Organize Your Ideas**: Structuring your essay into distinct paragraphs can help improve readability. You might begin with an introduction that briefly outlines the main challenges faced by the cyclist, followed by separate paragraphs that elaborate on each point with supporting evidence from the text.

3. **Clarify and Refine Your Language**: There are a few areas where refining your vocabulary and sentence structures could enhance clarity and interest. For example, instead of saying ""the road, the rocks everything close,"" you could say ""the treacherous road conditions and the sharp, scattered rocks."" This not only provides more vivid imagery but also makes your writing more engaging.

4. **Grammatical Accuracy**: Pay attention to grammar and punctuation to ensure your ideas are communicated clearly. For instance, ""That why its important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves"" should be corrected to ""That's why it's important for a cyclist to trust their own instincts.""

5. **Engage with the Text's Themes**: Reflect on how the setting not only poses physical challenges but also tests the cyclist’s mental and emotional endurance. This will add depth to your analysis and show a nuanced understanding of the text.

Here's a revised version of your paragraph to illustrate these suggestions:

""The features of the setting profoundly impact the cyclist in many ways. The rough terrain, with its sharp rocks and unpredictable conditions, poses significant physical challenges. For instance, the cyclist's encounter with a large snake blocking the road and the discovery of an abandoned ghost town highlight the isolation and danger of the journey. Moreover, the high desert heat and the scarcity of drinkable water test his endurance and resourcefulness. These examples underscore the importance of self-reliance for a cyclist, as relying on outdated or misguided advice can lead to perilous situations. This is why cyclists often stay close to well-traveled roads where help is readily available should they encounter trouble.""

Overall, your essay captures the essence of the cyclist's struggle with his environment. With some additional development and refinement, your writing will become even more compelling and insightful. Keep pushing the boundaries of your expression, and remember, your unique perspective is your greatest strength","

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Computers are very important, I dont know anyone who does not need one. But some people say that it distracts you from exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friend. Do I agree? No I disagree with this situation because computers are a modern day tech that people use. They say it distracts you from interacting with family and friends but a computer is the number one way to talk to long distance friends and family, @CAPS1 without a computer how will those people who work

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a clear stance on the importance of computers in modern life, demonstrating a strong grasp of the topic. Your arguments are focused and supported with relevant examples, such as the use of social media platforms like MySpace and Facebook for maintaining long-distance relationships, and the necessity of computers for business and research purposes. The introduction succinctly sets the stage for your argument, and the conclusion effectively reinforces your main points while offering practical advice on balancing computer use with other activities.

However, the structure of the essay could be improved for better readability. Organizing your points into distinct paragraphs with smooth transitions would enhance the flow of ideas. For example, separating the discussion on social media, business use, and research into individual paragraphs would make your essay more coherent. Additionally, while your vocabulary is appropriate and varied, further refinement in word choice could add more precision and interest to your writing.

Your sentence structures are varied and mostly effective, contributing to a smooth reading experience. Still, addressing some repetitive phrases and minor grammatical errors would elevate the overall quality. For instance, consistent capitalization, punctuation, and spelling accuracy are essential for clear communication, even though creative deviations are acceptable. 

Overall, your essay is engaging and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. With some improvements in organization and attention to detail in language use, your writing will be even more impactful and enjoyable to read.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to discuss the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the story. The ideas are underdeveloped and the content is minimal, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the intended message. There is a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points being made, which weakens the overall argument. The response also tends to wander off-topic and does not adhere closely to the prompt. The language used is simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors, such as ""shes"" instead of ""she's"" and ""sentance"" instead of ""sentence."" These errors distract from the readability of the essay and hinder its effectiveness. Additionally, the essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes the narrative difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing detailed support from the story, maintaining clarity in addressing the prompt, enhancing vocabulary, and ensuring a smooth flow of ideas with proper transitions.

DOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit 
by Joe Kurmaskie 
FORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece 
of advice for the solo cyclist would be, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers 
who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” It’s not that a group of 
old guys doesn’t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid 
place. Things change. 
At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer 
evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn’t have done was 
let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice 
and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to 
Yosemite National Park. 
They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I 
would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with 
strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town.” 
This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time—say, before the last world war—but 
on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water 
supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool 
pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. 
Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, 
and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had 
been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of 
California in June. 
I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my 
strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the 
neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water 
wouldn’t cool down. It didn’t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. 
The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make 
that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so—a test of my inner spirit. 
Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was 
replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign 
jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. 
The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so 
cruel. 
I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it 
really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased 
past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. 
The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my 
shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June 
simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, 
caused me to laugh. 
It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. 
There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride 
down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d 
be fine. 
Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make 
sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst 
of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. 
In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building—abandoned years 
earlier, by the looks of it—had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A 
sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still 
be seen. 
I hung my head. 
That smoky blues tune “Summertime” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating 
brain. 
I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. 
I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you 
have left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. 
It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some 
expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and 
their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I 
was going to lose consciousness for the last time. 
Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining 
elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear 
were all behind me. 
GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP—IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE 
YOUR BEST BET! 
“And the only bet,” I remember thinking. 
As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an 
overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait—any bait, even 
though I didn’t own a rod or reel. 
An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from 
my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. 
“Where you headed in such a hurry?” 
“Yosemite,” I whispered. 
“Know the best way to get there?” 
I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group 
I’d listened to in Lodi. 
“Yes, sir! I own a very good map.” 
And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The features affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the road, the rocks everything close. The cyclist needs to know everything about where he's going, because if not then he can run into some problems along the way, For example like snakes, rough terrain, rocks in the way.

TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","FEEDBACK:

Thank you for your essay. I can see that you have put thought into how a cyclist needs to be aware of their surroundings. However, there are several areas you could improve:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: Your essay could benefit from clearer organization. Try to structure your ideas in a more logical order. For instance, first discuss the various features that affect cyclists, then explain the importance of being aware of these features. 

2. **Detail and Examples**: While you mention several factors that can affect a cyclist, such as roads, rocks, and snakes, it would be helpful to expand on these points with more detailed examples or explanations. For instance, explain how rough terrain specifically affects cycling.

3. **Grammar and Punctuation**: There are several grammatical errors and incomplete sentences that need attention. For example, ""For example the road, the rocks everything close."" could be revised to ""For example, the road, the rocks, and everything nearby can affect the cyclist."" Also, ""That why its important"" should be ""That's why it's important.""

4. **Pronoun Consistency**: Be consistent with pronoun usage. You shift between ""he"" and ""they"". Pick one and stick to it throughout the essay to maintain clarity.

5. **Misconceptions**: The line ""That why its important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves"" might be misleading. Cyclists often need to heed advice from experienced cyclists, maps, or even safety instructions. Consider revising this to emphasize the importance of being self-reliant while also staying informed.

6. **Safety and Context**: When you mention that cyclists are often seen on roads with cars, it’s important to clarify the context. Stress the importance of safety and being visible to others on the road, and perhaps mention the value of wearing protective gear like helmets.

Here is a revised version of your essay with these suggestions incorporated:

---

The features of the environment affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the road conditions, nearby rocks, and other environmental factors can significantly impact the ride. A cyclist needs to be fully aware of their surroundings because if they are not, they can encounter problems along the way, such as encountering snakes, navigating rough terrain, or avoiding rocks in their path. 

That's why it's important for a cyclist to be well-prepared and informed about their route. While self-reliance is crucial, cyclists should also take advice from reliable sources and use appropriate tools like maps and safety guidelines. 

When you often see cyclists on roads shared with cars, it is important to remember that this choice is made for visibility and safety. Cyclists need to ensure they are visible to drivers and are following traffic rules to minimize risks. Wearing protective gear, such as helmets and reflective clothing, further enhances their safety on busy roads.

Keep up the good work, and keep refining your writing skills!",0.9001994864344323,0.8756565347406366
28,93,"The essay on how settings affect cyclists falls significantly short of the expectations set forth by the teacher's guidelines. The content is simplistic and lacks originality and depth, failing to provide unique or creative insights into the topic. The thesis statement is not clearly defined, and the supporting arguments are underdeveloped and repetitive. The overall organization is weak, with an abrupt and unengaging introduction, poorly structured body paragraphs, and a conclusion that does not offer a fresh perspective. The essay lacks creativity in its flow of ideas, making it difficult to follow. Additionally, the language and style are monotonous and lack variation, with numerous grammatical errors that detract from readability. There is little to no imaginative vocabulary or sentence structure, and the writing does not demonstrate control of standard writing conventions. Overall, the essay needs significant improvement in clarity, structure, content, and language to meet the desired criteria of originality and creative expression.",93,"Your essay does a good job of introducing how the setting affects the cyclist, and you have some interesting points that highlight the relationship between physical surroundings and the rider's experience. I appreciate your effort to draw a clear connection between the environment and the cyclist's state of mind and physical condition. This is a solid foundation that can be built upon to create a more compelling narrative. Let's work on enhancing your argument with more specific examples and varied language to make your writing more engaging and detailed.

Firstly, it's important to provide specific examples from the source text to support your claims. For instance, you mention that a challenging setting can cause the cyclist more pain and dehydration. You could elaborate on this by referencing the part of the text where the cyclist struggles with the rough terrain and lack of water. Including direct quotes or detailed descriptions from the text will strengthen your argument and show a deeper understanding of the source material.

Secondly, let's work on making your language more varied and imaginative. Instead of saying ""nice"" or ""not nice,"" you could describe the settings more vividly. For example, ""If the setting is serene and picturesque, it allows the rider to immerse in the beauty around them, thus distracting from any physical discomfort."" Similarly, for a challenging setting, you might say, ""A harsh, barren landscape exacerbates the rider's physical strain, making every pedal stroke a test of endurance.""

Additionally, while your points are clear, the organization of your essay can be improved to create a smoother flow of ideas. Consider starting with a brief introduction that outlines the main points you will discuss. Then, dedicate each paragraph to a specific aspect of the setting's impact on the cyclist, supported by examples from the text. This structure will make your essay easier to follow and more persuasive.

Lastly, be mindful of your grammar and punctuation. Ensure that each sentence starts with a capital letter and that your sentences are varied in structure to maintain the reader's interest. For example, instead of repeating ""the cyclist could could,"" you might say, ""the cyclist could become increasingly dehydrated, compounding their physical challenges.""

Your essay has great potential, and with a few adjustments, it can truly shine. Keep exploring your creative voice and don't hesitate to take risks with your language and ideas. I'm excited to see how you will refine and develop this piece further. Keep up the excellent work!","

Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: outside they don't talk to there friends or even see ther friends its mostly not haven a life. And people dont feel like going to school because their over and there tired and ther just want to use the computer all day with not stopping. And so i think that people are just to addicted to compulers they dont use it for the fright reasons. Had then people get sick they could get hoadaks or they feel like puking. And they dont get to see that of things like go to the @CAPS1, @CAPS2 football,

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates an attempt to discuss the impact of computer usage on individuals, but it lacks clarity and effective organization. The main ideas are present but not fully developed or supported with specific details, making the overall argument somewhat simplistic and broad. The essay's structure is disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a need for a clearer flow of ideas. The language used is repetitive and often inappropriate, with many words misused or misspelled, which detracts significantly from the intended message. Sentence structures are awkward and lack fluidity, causing the reader to frequently pause and reread for comprehension. Additionally, the essay contains numerous grammatical errors, incorrect punctuation, and inconsistent capitalization, which further impede readability. However, there are moments of creative expression, and the writer's point of view is clearly stated, though it requires more refinement and stronger support to be more persuasive and engaging. Improving these areas with a focus on originality and imaginative language use, while maintaining grammatical accuracy, will enhance the overall quality of the essay.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to discuss the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the story. The ideas are underdeveloped and the content is minimal, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the intended message. There is a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points being made, which weakens the overall argument. The response also tends to wander off-topic and does not adhere closely to the prompt. The language used is simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors, such as ""shes"" instead of ""she's"" and ""sentance"" instead of ""sentence."" These errors distract from the readability of the essay and hinder its effectiveness. Additionally, the essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes the narrative difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing detailed support from the story, maintaining clarity in addressing the prompt, enhancing vocabulary, and ensuring a smooth flow of ideas with proper transitions.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: loss there is also a health issue. Many people are talking about how americans are becoming obise. Part @MONEY1 this is due to spending too much time on the computer. Proffesor @CAPS3 @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 says that, ""the obisety in @LOCATION1 is a problem, if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, that problem would be solved."" @CAPS4, @NUM5 out @MONEY1 @NUM6 people are obese. If everyone spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, it would become @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM6.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and focused argument against excessive computer use, supported by recognizable main ideas: financial loss, health issues, and community disintegration. The originality of the thesis could be improved by providing a more unique or thought-provoking perspective on the topic. The essay is satisfactorily organized, with a basic introduction, body, and conclusion, though the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow of ideas. The word choice effectively conveys the intended message, but there is room for more varied and imaginative language to make the essay more engaging. The sentences generally flow well, though some constructions could be more fluid and varied to maintain the reader’s interest. The essay demonstrates control of standard writing conventions, but there are noticeable errors in spelling and grammar that slightly impede readability. Overall, the essay is clear and persuasive but could benefit from more creative expression and polished language use to fully align with the teacher's emphasis on originality and creative expression.

DOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit 
by Joe Kurmaskie 
FORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece 
of advice for the solo cyclist would be, “Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers 
who haven’t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.” It’s not that a group of 
old guys doesn’t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid 
place. Things change. 
At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer 
evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn’t have done was 
let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice 
and launched out at first light along a “shortcut” that was to slice away hours from my ride to 
Yosemite National Park. 
They’d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I 
would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with 
strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first “town.” 
This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time—say, before the last world war—but 
on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water 
supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool 
pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. 
Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, 
and a corral that couldn’t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had 
been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of 
California in June. 
I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my 
strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the 
neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water 
wouldn’t cool down. It didn’t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. 
The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make 
that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so—a test of my inner spirit. 
Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was 
replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign 
jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. 
The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so 
cruel. 
I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake—it 
really did look like a diamondback—blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased 
past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. 
The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my 
shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June 
simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn’t been off their porch in decades, 
caused me to laugh. 
It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. 
There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride 
down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I’d 
be fine. 
Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make 
sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst 
of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. 
In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building—abandoned years 
earlier, by the looks of it—had been a Welch’s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A 
sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still 
be seen. 
I hung my head. 
That smoky blues tune “Summertime” rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating 
brain. 
I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. 
I’d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you 
have left to circulate. With any luck I’d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. 
It didn’t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some 
expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and 
their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I 
was going to lose consciousness for the last time. 
Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining 
elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear 
were all behind me. 
GARY AND WILBER’S FISH CAMP—IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE’RE 
YOUR BEST BET! 
“And the only bet,” I remember thinking. 
As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an 
overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait—any bait, even 
though I didn’t own a rod or reel. 
An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from 
my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. 
“Where you headed in such a hurry?” 
“Yosemite,” I whispered. 
“Know the best way to get there?” 
I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group 
I’d listened to in Lodi. 
“Yes, sir! I own a very good map.” 
And I promised myself right then that I’d always stick to it in the future.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isnt very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Dear Student,

Thank you for your effort in writing this essay. Here are some points of feedback to help you improve your writing:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**:
   - The main idea of your essay is clear, but it would benefit from a more structured approach. Consider breaking your ideas into distinct paragraphs, each focusing on a specific aspect of how settings affect cyclists.
   - Ensure that each sentence logically flows from one to the next. This will make your argument more coherent and easier to follow.

2. **Grammar and Punctuation**:
   - Pay attention to capitalization and punctuation. For example, ""also"" should be capitalized at the beginning of a sentence, and ""isn't very nice"" should be separated with a comma.
   - Eliminate any typographical errors like the use of ""&"" instead of ""and"" and ""@MONTH1"" which seems to be a placeholder error.

3. **Word Choice and Sentence Structure**:
   - Varied sentence structure can make your writing more engaging. Try to avoid repetitive phrasing, such as ""the rider... the rider..."".
   - Avoid using words like ""drive"" when referring to cycling; ""ride"" would be more appropriate.

4. **Depth of Analysis**:
   - Provide more detailed examples or explanations to support your points. For instance, explain how a beautiful setting can enhance the cycling experience or provide more details on how a hilly terrain can affect a cyclist's performance.

Here’s a revised version of your paragraph to illustrate these points:

""The settings affect cyclists in a variety of ways. If the setting is pleasant, the rider can focus on the scenery rather than the discomfort they might be experiencing. Conversely, if the surroundings are less appealing, the rider is likely to concentrate more on their pain than their environment. Additionally, a hilly terrain presents a physical challenge, causing the cyclist to exert more effort, which can lead to increased pain and quicker dehydration. Clearly, the setting plays a significant role in a cyclist's overall experience.""

Keep working on refining your writing, and don't hesitate to seek feedback and revise your work. Great job, and keep up the good effort!

Best regards,

29,95,"The essay on Saeng's attempts to adjust to her new home lacks depth and detail, making it difficult to engage with the content fully. The thesis is overly simplistic and not particularly original or thought-provoking, and the supporting arguments are underdeveloped. There is no innovative or creative angle that captures the reader's interest. The organization of the essay is weak, with a brief and unengaging introduction, body paragraphs that lack depth and smooth transitions, and an abrupt conclusion that does not provide a fresh perspective. The language and style are very basic, with a limited range of vocabulary and sentence structures that do not demonstrate creativity or variety. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors and awkward constructions that impede readability. Overall, the essay does not meet the criteria for originality, creative expression, or imaginative language use. To improve, the writer should focus on developing a unique and compelling thesis, providing richer and more creative supporting arguments, and enhancing the organization and flow of ideas. Using more varied and imaginative language and ensuring grammatical accuracy would also significantly enhance the essay's quality.",95,"Your response touches on the central theme of Saeng’s struggle to adapt to her new environment while holding on to memories of her homeland. You've identified an important aspect of Saeng's journey—her determination to keep trying, despite her longing for her old home. This is a great start and shows a good grasp of the character's emotions.

To further enhance your essay, consider adding more detailed examples from the story to support your points. For instance, you could discuss specific moments when Saeng feels a connection to her past, like when she recognizes the hibiscus or smells the jasmine. These examples would enrich your argument and provide a clearer picture of her inner conflict and resilience.

Additionally, expanding your vocabulary and varying your sentence structures can make your writing more engaging. Instead of saying, ""Saeng is trying to be ok with her new home,"" you might try, ""Saeng grapples with her sense of displacement as she endeavors to embrace her new surroundings."" This not only adds depth but also enhances the reader’s experience.

Also, your essay could benefit from a more structured approach. Start with an engaging introduction that sets the tone for your analysis, followed by body paragraphs that each focus on a specific aspect of Saeng's struggle, and conclude with a reflective summary that ties all your points together.

Finally, ensure your grammar and spelling are accurate to maintain readability. For example, ""She is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home"" could be more powerfully expressed as ""She remains steadfast in her efforts to acclimate to her new home.""

Remember, your unique perspective and creative expression are what make your writing special. Keep pushing the boundaries of your ideas and exploring new ways to articulate them. Excellent effort, and I look forward to seeing how you further develop your thoughts!","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to discuss the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the story. The ideas are underdeveloped and the content is minimal, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the intended message. There is a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points being made, which weakens the overall argument. The response also tends to wander off-topic and does not adhere closely to the prompt. The language used is simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors, such as ""shes"" instead of ""she's"" and ""sentance"" instead of ""sentence."" These errors distract from the readability of the essay and hinder its effectiveness. Additionally, the essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes the narrative difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing detailed support from the story, maintaining clarity in addressing the prompt, enhancing vocabulary, and ensuring a smooth flow of ideas with proper transitions.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: he really has a family, that show they care. He appreciates what his parents have done for him. You can tell his very greatful because of the way he expresses himself about his family. ""In reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spint of generosity impressed upon me, and demonstrate of how important family and friends are"". He is a caring young boy.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a genuine effort to explore the theme of family gratitude in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, but it lacks the originality and creative expression that could elevate it. While it includes specific quotations from the memoir, the analysis remains superficial and doesn't delve deeply into the unique aspects of Rodriguez's experiences or emotions. The introduction could be more engaging, and the body paragraphs would benefit from smoother transitions and more innovative development of arguments. The vocabulary and sentence structures are fairly basic, and there are several grammatical errors, such as inconsistencies in the spelling of ""grateful"" and issues with punctuation and capitalization. Additionally, the essay could improve its narrative flow by enhancing the use of transitional words and providing a more conversational tone. Overall, while the essay addresses some of the key points from the memoir, it would benefit from a more creative approach and a deeper analysis to fully capture the essence of Rodriguez's gratitude towards his family.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: c.The mood in this passage Narciso Rodriguez's home, nationality, and his family. He often talks about his nationality. He is proud to be born in Cuba and not afraid to say it. He is also married. He lives in the @DATE1's. In america. He also often talks about his @NUM1 bedroom apartment in Newark, New Jersey. He aslo likes to talk about the new freinds he mad here. And his family. Also Narciso childhood. His neighborhood is made out of cubans, And @CAPS1. That was the memoir of this passage.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a minimal understanding of the content about Narciso Rodriguez's background and experiences. While it mentions his Cuban nationality and pride, as well as his residence in Newark and family dynamics, it lacks specificity and depth in its supporting arguments. The response does not effectively utilize evidence from the memoir to strengthen its points, leading to a surface-level engagement with the topic. In terms of language, the essay demonstrates adequate grammar and spelling, with some minor errors and a limited range of vocabulary. The structure is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of cohesive flow between ideas, making it challenging to follow the narrative smoothly. Enhancing the originality and creativity in the development of the thesis, supporting arguments, and conclusion would greatly improve the overall quality of the essay. Additionally, incorporating a more engaging introduction and imaginative use of language and sentence structures would elevate the essay's appeal.

DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus 
by Minfong Ho 
Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng
walks home after failing her driver’s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist
shop to see if the plant can be purchased. 
It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat
leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in
seemingly random profusion. 
“Over there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?” The florist pointed at a leafy
potted plant by the corner. 
There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals
splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of
recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 
“Saebba,” Saeng whispered. 
A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with
vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into
the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the
bucket. 
Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,
oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had
not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. 
When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and
cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center—just as she had known it would feel. 
And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with
purplish petals and white centers. “Madagascar periwinkle,” its tag announced. How strange to
see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick
walls or between tiled roofs. 
And that rich, sweet scent—that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and
found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.
“Dok Malik,” she said,
savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its
tag, “jasmine.” 
One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed
her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could
almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she
combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng
would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. 
Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm
around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed
comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? 
A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a
channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. 
And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. 
It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the
last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.
As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of
the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to
her. 
Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. “Ghup ma laio le? You’re back?” she said cheerfully.
“Goodness, it’s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you—?” Then she noticed
the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. 
Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. “Dok faeng-noi!” she said. “Where
did you get it?” 
“I bought it,” Saeng answered, dreading her mother’s next question. 
“How much?” 
For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. 
“That’s all?” Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, “Oh, but I forgot! You and the 
Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .” 
“No, we didn’t, Mother,” Saeng said. 
“Then what else—?” 
“Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.” 
“You what?” Her mother stared at her incredulously. “But how could you? All the seeds for this
vegetable garden didn’t cost that much! You know how much we—” She paused, as she noticed
the tearstains on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes. 
“What happened?” she asked, more gently. 
“I—I failed the test,” Saeng said. 
For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the
eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. 
Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng’s hands. “It’s a beautiful
plant, this dok faeng-noi,” she finally said. “I’m glad you got it.” 
“It’s—it’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. 
“I mean, not like the kind we had at—at—” She found that she was still too shaky to say the
words at home, lest she burst into tears again. “Not like the kind we had before,” she said. 
“I know,” her mother said quietly. “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t
as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.
That’s what matters.” 
She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her
other hand. “Look how root-bound it is, poor thing,” she said. “Let’s plant it, right now.” 
She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The
soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair
trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There
was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. 
“Here, let me help, Mother,” she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. 
Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. “I’ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and
start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?” 
“I’d love it,” Saeng said. 
Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.
She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,
the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng’s mouth
watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered—none of her classmates or friends, not
even Mrs. Lambert, liked it—this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.
But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. 
The “winter hibiscus” was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.
Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and—yes—familiar to Saeng
now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange
before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her
now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against
the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. 
When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the
geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: In the story Saeng is trying to be ok with her new home. I think the author put that in the story to show that she has not given up. She is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home. Saeng wants to adjust but she misses her old home too much. That is why she is waiting till spring to try again.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","FEEDBACK:

Thank you for sharing your essay on the story of Saeng. You have captured an important aspect of the character's journey and her determination to adjust to her new home. Here are a few suggestions to help you improve your writing further:

1. **Introduction and Conclusion**: Try to add an introductory sentence that briefly introduces the story and the main point you will be discussing. Similarly, a concluding sentence that summarizes your thoughts or reflects on the character's journey would help to give your essay a clear beginning and end.

2. **Elaboration**: You mentioned that Saeng is trying to be okay with her new home and that she has not given up. Expanding on specific examples from the story that show how Saeng is trying to adjust would strengthen your argument. Describe what actions she takes or what thoughts she has that illustrate her perseverance.

3. **Clarity and Detail**: You noted that Saeng misses her old home too much and is waiting until spring to try again. It might be helpful to explain why spring is significant. Is there a particular reason or event that makes spring a better time for her to try again? Adding these details will provide a clearer picture of her situation.

4. **Grammar and Structure**: Make sure each sentence flows logically to the next. For example, instead of ""That is why she is waiting till spring to try again,"" you could say, ""Because she misses her old home so much, Saeng decides to wait until spring to try adjusting again."" This helps to connect your ideas more smoothly.

5. **Evidence and Quotes**: If possible, include direct quotes or specific passages from the story to support your points. This can make your argument more convincing and show that you have a deep understanding of the text.

Overall, you have a good foundation, and with a bit more detail and structure, your essay can effectively convey Saeng's emotional journey and determination.

You provide a thorough description of the author's childhood home, neighborhood, and the relationships that enriched his life, supported by specific references to the memoir. The use of vivid imagery and personal anecdotes helps to create an engaging narrative, although there are some minor errors in grammar and punctuation that could be refined.

Overall, your essay stays on topic and conveys a clear understanding of the memoir, making it an enjoyable and informative read.",99,"Your essay does a commendable job of capturing the warm and familial atmosphere that Narciso Rodriguez creates in his memoir. The organization of your paragraphs, each focusing on different aspects of Rodriguez's life and the mood he portrays, shows a clear structure and logical progression in your ideas. You've effectively highlighted the vivid imagery Rodriguez uses to depict his childhood home, neighborhood, and the sacrifices of his parents, which indeed creates a touching narrative.

However, let's elevate your essay further by incorporating more originality and deeper analysis. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Engage More Deeply with the Text**: While you’ve done well to outline the main points, try to delve deeper into how these elements interact to establish the mood. For instance, how does the Cuban music and cuisine specifically contribute to the sense of comfort and belonging? Elaborate on how the cultural diversity in his neighborhood not only reflects kindness but also resilience and unity, especially in the face of overt racism and segregation.

2. **Enhance Your Creative Expression**: Your essay would benefit from a more varied and imaginative use of language. Experiment with more descriptive adjectives and vivid verbs to bring your narrative to life. For example, instead of saying ""he described his childhood home,"" you might write ""Rodriguez vividly transports us to his childhood haven, where the air was perfumed with the rich aromas of Cuban cuisine and the rhythmic beats of passionate music.""

3. **Strengthen Transitions and Flow**: While your essay is well-organized, consider using more transitional phrases to ensure a smoother flow between paragraphs. Phrases like ""Moreover,"" ""In addition,"" or ""Furthermore"" can help guide the reader through your arguments seamlessly.

4. **Refine Your Conclusion**: The conclusion is clear and touches on all the points discussed, but it can be more impactful. Summarize not just that the article is pleasing to read and touches the heart, but also reflect on the broader implications of Rodriguez's narrative. How does his story of family, sacrifice, and community resonate with or inspire the reader?

5. **Proofread for Minor Errors**: There are minor grammatical errors such as ""Narciso described,"" which should be ""Narciso describes,"" to maintain consistency in tense. Also, ensure correct punctuation and capitalization throughout.

In essence, your essay has strong foundational elements, and with a bit of fine-tuning and a more creative approach, it can truly shine. I’m excited to see how you further develop your unique voice and analytical skills. Keep pushing the boundaries of your expression!

Feel free to discuss any of these points further if you need additional guidance.","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: c.The mood in this passage Narciso Rodriguez's home, nationality, and his family. He often talks about his nationality. He is proud to be born in Cuba and not afraid to say it. He is also married. He lives in the @DATE1's. In america. He also often talks about his @NUM1 bedroom apartment in Newark, New Jersey. He aslo likes to talk about the new freinds he mad here. And his family. Also Narciso childhood. His neighborhood is made out of cubans, And @CAPS1. That was the memoir of this passage.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a minimal understanding of the content about Narciso Rodriguez's background and experiences. While it mentions his Cuban nationality and pride, as well as his residence in Newark and family dynamics, it lacks specificity and depth in its supporting arguments. The response does not effectively utilize evidence from the memoir to strengthen its points, leading to a surface-level engagement with the topic. In terms of language, the essay demonstrates adequate grammar and spelling, with some minor errors and a limited range of vocabulary. The structure is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of cohesive flow between ideas, making it challenging to follow the narrative smoothly. Enhancing the originality and creativity in the development of the thesis, supporting arguments, and conclusion would greatly improve the overall quality of the essay. Additionally, incorporating a more engaging introduction and imaginative use of language and sentence structures would elevate the essay's appeal.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Narciso Rodriguez is very grateful of his family. During this memoir he is very excited and thankful for the family he has. Like was said in the memoir ""I will always be greatful of my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 example of how Narciso show that he is greatful is ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, @CAPS2 thanked them repeatedly"". Narciso says he really has a family, that show they care. He appreciates what his parents have done for him.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a genuine effort to explore the theme of family gratitude in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, but it lacks the originality and creative expression that could elevate it. While it includes specific quotations from the memoir, the analysis remains superficial and doesn't delve deeply into the unique aspects of Rodriguez's experiences or emotions. The introduction could be more engaging, and the body paragraphs would benefit from smoother transitions and more innovative development of arguments. The vocabulary and sentence structures are fairly basic, and there are several grammatical errors, such as inconsistencies in the spelling of ""grateful"" and issues with punctuation and capitalization. Additionally, the essay could improve its narrative flow by enhancing the use of transitional words and providing a more conversational tone. Overall, while the essay addresses some of the key points from the memoir, it would benefit from a more creative approach and a deeper analysis to fully capture the essence of Rodriguez's gratitude towards his family.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created in the memoir is thoughtful and caring. ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. Narciso is very thankful and feels very much beloved in his family. In the mood in this memoir is not just thoughtful or kind or caring, it's the feeling loved and loving that feeling. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family.""

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a warm and heartfelt narrative of the author's family life, emphasizing the values of courage, love, and community. However, it lacks a clear and original thesis statement, which makes it challenging to grasp the central argument or unique perspective the writer aims to convey. The essay wanders at times, leading to a sense of disjointedness, especially in how the introduction and body paragraphs transition. The vocabulary is varied, but there are notable grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures that detract from the overall flow and coherence. While the narrative is somewhat engaging, it could benefit from more strategic use of transitional phrases to create a smoother reading experience. Additionally, while the memoir's essence is captured, more specific and consistent evidence from the provided excerpt would strengthen the arguments and maintain focus throughout the essay. Overall, the essay demonstrates potential but requires more refinement in structure, clarity, and adherence to the provided prompt.

DOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 5 Source.pdf
DOCUMENT CONTENT: Narciso Rodriguez 
from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives 
My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a 
furnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old 
Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon 
call home. 
In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the 
Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our 
traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared 
cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking 
that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which 
I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of 
childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed 
both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. 
Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that “family” had nothing to do with 
being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, 
Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation 
prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these 
cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of 
honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their 
own kind, were clearly in need. 
Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and 
Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio 
and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not 
know my “real” grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were 
allowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and 
Rosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family 
members came and went — and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they 
were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the 
many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. 
My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the 
language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a 
better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country 
they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters 
while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were 
strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind 
of jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had 
studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, 
taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their 
children to better times drove them to endure these hard times. 
I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I’ve often told them that what 
they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I’ve often told them of 
my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I’ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in 
reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at 
such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two 
lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these 
teachings have been the basis of my life. 
It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to 
this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this 
humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not 
just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of “family.” 
And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I 
learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into 
a home.
