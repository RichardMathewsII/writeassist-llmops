I provide specific suggestions on how to rearrange sections or rephrase parts of their work to improve readability and logical progression.\n\nIn the language and style category, I emphasize the appropriateness and precision of technical terminology and the complexity and clarity of sentence structures. I encourage students to use precise vocabulary and to construct sentences that, while complex, remain clear and unambiguous. My feedback often includes recommendations for vocabulary enhancement and sentence restructuring to achieve these goals.\n\nFinally, in the conventions category, I meticulously check for grammatical accuracy, correct spelling, punctuation, and capitalization.
