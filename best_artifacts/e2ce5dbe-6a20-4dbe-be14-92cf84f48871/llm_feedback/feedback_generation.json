If you are doing a project or need to look up information about something, the internet is one of the easiest ways to find that information.

However, the thesis could be more precise to provide a stronger foundation for the argument. The essay is well-organized, with clear transitions between points, although the topic sentences could be more defined to enhance readability. The use of language is mostly effective, but there are moments where vocabulary could be more varied and precise to convey the intended message more powerfully. Sentence structures are generally clear and varied, contributing to a smooth flow of ideas.

Computers can but promote bad habits. I try not to use the computer unless I have too for school or to get homework. Please consider the negative effects which are exercising in apropprate content and less interaction with friends/family. Yes internets can be used to find diets and exercise plans but if you would just go to the gym to burn of those pounds everything would be just fine!\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the negative effects of computer usage, primarily focusing on issues such as lack of exercise, exposure to inappropriate content, and reduced social interactions. However, the thesis statement lacks precision and clarity, and the arguments, though supported by personal anecdotes, are not substantiated with substantial evidence or data. The logical progression of ideas is somewhat present but fragmented, impacting the overall coherence. The structure of the essay could benefit from better-defined topic sentences and smoother transitions between paragraphs. The vocabulary used is appropriate, though there are areas where word choice could be more precise to enhance the overall message. Sentence structures are varied but occasionally awkward, which disrupts the flow of the essay. Grammatical errors, incorrect spelling, and punctuation issues are present but do not severely impede readability.

        "llmResponse": "Dear [Student],\n\nThank you for sharing your essay on the importance of computers in modern society. Your effort to explore the topic is commendable, and I appreciate your willingness to engage with such a relevant issue. Here are some specific points of feedback that should help you refine and strengthen your essay further:\n\n**Content:**\n- *Thesis Clarity*: The main argument of your essay\u2014that computers are essential in today's society\u2014needs to be articulated more precisely in your thesis statement. Providing a clear and strong thesis will give your essay a solid foundation.\n- *Evidence and Reasoning*: While you mention various ways computers are useful, such as looking up information and chatting with friends, these points would be more compelling with concrete evidence or data to support them. For example, including statistics or studies that document the benefits of computers would strengthen your arguments.\n\n**Organization:**\n- *Logical Structure*: Your essay would benefit from a more organized structure. Starting with a clear introduction that presents your thesis, followed by well-defined body paragraphs with distinct topic sentences, and concluding with a synthesizing conclusion would enhance readability and coherence.\n- *Transitions*: Ensure smooth transitions between your points to help the reader follow your argument more easily. For instance, when moving from chatting with friends to the importance of the local internet, use transitional phrases to ensure the ideas are connected logically.\n\n**Language and Style:**\n- *Precision and Clarity*: You have moments where your language is clear, but there are instances where precision is lacking. For example, the sentence \"Research shows over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 says computer is everything\" could be refined to be more specific and accurate. Make sure to replace placeholders like \"@PERCENT1\" with actual data and ensure all sentences are clear and precise.\n- *Vocabulary*: Be mindful of word choice to convey your ideas more effectively. Phrases like \"not trying to be mean\" could be replaced with more formal expressions to maintain an academic tone.\n\n**Conventions:**\n- *Grammar and Punctuation*: The essay contains several grammatical errors and punctuation issues. For instance, \"dident\" should be \"didn't,\" and \"Reseach\" should be \"Research.\" Carefully proofread your work to correct these mistakes.\n- *Capitalization*: Ensure proper use of capitalization throughout your essay. Terms like \"opinion\" and \"percent\" should not be capitalized unless they begin a sentence.\n\n**Overall Feedback:**\nYour essay presents an interesting perspective on the importance of computers, but it requires more precise articulation and stronger evidential support. A clearer thesis, better organization, improved clarity, and grammatical accuracy will significantly enhance your writing. Keep up the hard work, and continue to refine your skills; your dedication to improving your writing is evident and much appreciated.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Teacher's Name]",

I believe that even if books, music, movies or magazines on the bookshelves are offense, they should still be left there. They are apart of our history and the history we're creating.

You could just look them up online and read them or listen to them off the\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance against the practice, advocating for the preservation of all materials regardless of their potential to offend. The central argument\u2014that censorship is futile given technological access and potentially harmful to community dynamics\u2014is reasonably well-articulated, though it could benefit from more specific and detailed support. The essay lacks a cohesive structure, with ideas presented in a somewhat disjointed manner. Clearer transitions and a more organized flow of arguments would enhance readability and effectiveness. The vocabulary used is appropriate and conveys the intended message, though there are some areas where more precise language could strengthen the argument. Sentence structures are varied but occasionally awkward, disrupting the overall fluidity of the text. While the essay demonstrates a good command of basic writing conventions, a few grammatical errors and inconsistencies (such as \"i've\" instead of \"I've\") need attention. Overall, the essay makes a strong case but would benefit from a more polished and systematically organized presentation.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: that could be debated about being censored.     A lot of books and movies, great ones even, contain some offensive content but they are classics. Generations, one after the other, have enjoyed them.

I would like more organization for certian things, I do know people have their own ideas about things that should be in a book. These books found in a library could bring enjoyment to people,\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear stance on the need for a more organized system in libraries to help users avoid content they may find offensive. However, the thesis lacks precision and could benefit from a more focused statement of purpose. The arguments presented are somewhat repetitive and underdeveloped, lacking substantial evidence or logical reasoning to support the proposed solution. The essay is disorganized, with ideas not flowing logically from one to the next. Transitions between paragraphs are weak, making it difficult to follow the argument. The language used is simplistic and contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors, which detract from the essay's overall effectiveness. Additionally, the sentence structures are often awkward and unclear, further impeding readability. To improve, the essay needs a clearer thesis, better-developed arguments supported by concrete evidence, a more logical organization, varied and precise word choice, and meticulous proofreading to correct language conventions.\n\n\n\n---------------------------\n\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: In my opinion, I do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves.

        "llmResponse": "The essay on the appropriateness of library materials presents a strong opinion on the matter, advocating for a selective approach to what should be available to young readers. Your argument\u2014that certain offensive materials should be restricted to adults\u2014addresses an important concern but would benefit from more detailed and specific support.\n\n**Content:**\nYour thesis is clear, but it needs to be more precise. Instead of broadly stating that \"offensive materials\" should be restricted, specify what you mean by \"offensive\" and why these materials pose a particular threat. Additionally, while you mention books and movies as problematic due to violence and inappropriate behavior, more concrete examples would strengthen your argument.\n\n**Organization:**\nThe essay lacks a cohesive structure, making it difficult to follow your line of reasoning. Your points are somewhat repetitive and could be better organized into distinct paragraphs with clear topic sentences. For instance, one paragraph could focus on the potential harm of violent content, another on inappropriate behavior, and another on proposed solutions like restricted access for adults only.\n\n**Language and Style:**\nYour language is somewhat simplistic and could be more precise. Avoid using conversational phrases like \"these days\" or rhetorical questions such as \"What do you think?\" These weaken the academic tone of your essay. Instead, use formal language and support your claims with evidence and logical reasoning.\n\n**Conventions:**\nThere are several grammatical errors and awkward sentences that disrupt the flow of your essay. For example, \"against some peoples religion\" should be \"against some people's religion,\" and \"based of a book series\" should be \"based on a book series.\" Additionally, ensure you use the correct form of modal verbs like \"may\" or \"might\" instead of \"@MONTH1.\" Meticulous proofreading is essential to correct these errors and enhance readability.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n1. **Clarify Your Thesis:** Specify what constitutes \"offensive materials\" and why they should be restricted.\n2. **Provide Specific Examples:** Use concrete examples of books, movies, or shows that illustrate your points about violence and inappropriate behavior.\n3. **Enhance Organization:** Create clear, distinct paragraphs with well-defined topic sentences and logical transitions between ideas.\n4. **Refine Language and Style:** Use more formal, precise language and avoid conversational phrases.\n5. **Proofread Thoroughly:** Address grammatical errors, awkward sentences, and punctuation issues to improve the overall quality of your writing.\n\nYour essay addresses an important issue with clear passion and concern. By focusing on these areas for improvement, you can strengthen your argument and present a more compelling case. Keep up the hard work, and continue refining your writing skills!",

They had to dismiss many hardships such as lack of water, being lost, immense desert heat, plus minor things like snakes and road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June was the most intense hardship. That and the lack of water. Though the heat starting powing at the cyclists\u0092 brain by making them see mirages, etc. The heat and entire setting made the cyclists\u0092 travel much harder.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a general overview of the cyclist's hardships during their journey through the California desert, mentioning issues such as extreme heat, lack of water, and challenging terrain. While the central idea is identifiable, it lacks depth and specificity, requiring more substantial evidence and detailed examples to bolster the main points. The essay's organization is somewhat disjointed, with ideas not fully fleshed out or logically connected, leading to a lack of smooth narrative flow. Transitional phrases and topic sentences are sparse, which hampers the coherence and fluidity of the text. Furthermore, the language used is basic and occasionally imprecise, with some grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures that detract from the overall readability. Enhancing the clarity of arguments, providing more detailed examples, and polishing the language would significantly improve the effectiveness of the essay.\n\n\n\n---------------------------\n\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The setting affected the cyclist, because he didn\u0092t know if he was going to die or live. He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "The setting affected the cyclist, because he didn\u2019t know if he was going to die or live. He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry.\n\n---\n\n**Teacher Feedback:**\n\nYou\u2019ve done a commendable job in identifying the main impact of the setting on the cyclist. However, to develop a more compelling and robust argument, this passage requires additional detail and evidence from the text.\n\n**Content**: Your thesis is on the right track but needs more depth. Instead of simply stating the cyclist\u2019s uncertainty about survival, delve into how the setting's harsh conditions contributed to his fear and desperation. Provide specific examples and quotations from the text to support your claims, such as any particular descriptions of the heat or the cyclist's physical and emotional reactions.\n\n**Organization**: The passage is quite brief, making it challenging to identify a clear structure. To improve, consider breaking it down into multiple sentences that clearly outline the cause-and-effect relationship between the setting and the cyclist's predicament. Start with the setting, explain its effects on the cyclist, and conclude with how these effects influenced his psychological state.\n\n**Language and Style**: Your language is straightforward, which is a good starting point. However, aim to use more precise and varied vocabulary to convey the severity of the situation. Instead of saying \"it was so hot,\" you could describe the heat as \"oppressive\" or \"scorching.\" Additionally, \"he didn\u2019t know if he was going to die or live\" could be rephrased to capture the cyclist's panic more vividly.\n\n**Conventions**: Pay attention to grammatical details. For example, the phrase \"because it was so hot and his mouth was dry\" could be more effectively structured. Consider rephrasing to \"due to the oppressive heat, which left his mouth parched.\" This not only corrects the structure but also adds precision to your description.\n\n**Summary**: To enhance your essay, focus on providing substantial evidence, developing a clear and logical structure, and refining your language for precision and impact. Incorporate detailed examples and ensure grammatical accuracy to make your argument more compelling. Keep up the effort, and continue to refine these skills!\n\n---\n\nBy focusing on these areas, you will be able to construct a more nuanced and persuasive argument, which is crucial for your development as a writer.",

The thesis of the essay lacks clarity and precision, making it difficult for the reader to grasp the main argument being presented. The points made are somewhat vague and not well supported with specific evidence or logical reasoning. There are no examples or details from the story to substantiate the claims, leaving the arguments unconvincing. Additionally, the structure of the essay is disjointed. There is an absence of coherent transitions and well-defined topic sentences, which disrupts the logical flow of ideas and makes the narrative hard to follow. The language and style are not suitable for an academic essay, with several grammatical errors, incorrect punctuation, and awkward sentence structures that hinder readability. Technical terminology is not utilized effectively, leading to a lack of precision and variety in vocabulary.

The central idea of what Saeng means at the end of the paragraph is not clear, and the arguments presented are vague and unsupported by any substantial evidence or logical reasoning. The essay is exceptionally brief and does not offer a concrete thesis or any developed arguments. The sentences are fragmented, and there is a noticeable absence of transitional phrases and logical progression, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. Additionally, the vocabulary is not used effectively, and the language is simplistic and imprecise. Grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, and spelling mistakes further impede the readability of the essay. Overall, the essay does not meet the expectations for a well-reasoned, evidence-based argument and falls short in all evaluated categories.

However, the clarity of the thesis could be enhanced with a more precise statement at the beginning. The structure of the essay shows logical progression, with well-defined paragraphs and a coherent flow of ideas, though some transitions could be smoother to enhance readability. The use of technical terminology and vocabulary is appropriate, and the sentence structures are varied and generally correct, though there are minor grammatical errors that could be refined for higher precision. The conclusion effectively synthesizes the arguments presented, reinforcing the theme of gratitude and the impact of the parents' sacrifices on the author's life. Overall, the essay is engaging and maintains the reader's interest, with good use of evidence from the memoir to support its points.

        "llmResponse": "The sentence \"So she did not forget to take the test again.\" indicates a basic understanding of the narrative but lacks depth and context. Here are some areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Content and Argumentation**:\n   - The sentence is too simplistic and does not convey a clear, well-reasoned argument. To enhance the content, provide more context and details about why taking the test again is significant. Explain how this action connects to the broader themes or character development in the story.\n\n2. **Thesis and Focus**:\n   - Ensure that your main argument or thesis is clearly stated and supported throughout your essay. This sentence could serve as a supporting detail but should be linked to a more comprehensive argument.\n\n3. **Organization and Structure**:\n   - The sentence lacks a clear topic sentence or transition. Integrate it into a paragraph with a clear topic sentence that outlines the main idea, and use transitions to connect it smoothly with other parts of your essay.\n\n4. **Language and Style**:\n   - Use more precise and varied vocabulary to convey your ideas effectively. For example, instead of \"take the test again,\" you could say \"undertake the test once more to demonstrate her resilience and determination.\"\n\n5. **Conventions**:\n   - The sentence is grammatically correct but could benefit from more complex sentence structures to enhance readability and interest.\n\n**Revised Example**:\n\"Determined not to let her prior failure define her, she meticulously prepared and did not forget to retake the test, showcasing her perseverance and growth.\"\n\nOverall, while the original sentence captures a key action, it needs to be expanded and integrated into a more comprehensive and well-structured argument.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay offers a general understanding of the author's mood and experiences, but it needs significant refinement in several key areas to align with academic expectations and our class goals. \n\n**Content**:\n- **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis statement is somewhat unclear and not prominently positioned. It would benefit from being more precise and clearly stated at the beginning. For instance, you could explicitly state, \"The author's mood is characterized by pride and gratitude due to his parents' sacrifices and kindness.\"\n- **Evidence and Support**: While you mention several instances that show the author's parents' generosity and struggles, these points need to be developed with more concrete examples and logical reasoning. For example, explain how specific actions of the parents (like taking any job to support the family) directly contribute to the author's sense of pride and gratitude.\n\n**Organization**:\n- **Structure**: The essay lacks clear and logical progression. Each point should be organized into distinct paragraphs with well-defined topic sentences. Start by introducing the main idea, followed by supporting details, and conclude with a sentence that links back to your thesis.\n- **Transitions**: Improve the coherence of your essay by using smoother transitions between ideas. Phrases like \"Furthermore,\" \"Additionally,\" and \"As a result,\" can help guide the reader through your argument.\n\n**Language and Style**:\n- **Vocabulary**: Enhance your vocabulary to convey your ideas more precisely. For example, instead of \"very nice people,\" you could say \"remarkably compassionate individuals.\"\n- **Sentence Structure**: Work on constructing more complex yet clear sentences. Instead of stringing multiple ideas into one long sentence, break them down into shorter, more manageable sentences.\n\n**Conventions**:\n- **Grammar and Spelling**: There are numerous grammatical errors, such as incorrect possessive forms (\"there\" should be \"their\"), subject-verb agreement issues, and punctuation errors. Proofread your work carefully or use grammar-check tools to catch these mistakes.\n- **Punctuation and Capitalization**: Ensure proper punctuation and capitalization throughout the essay. For example, \"When they didn't have much money, they took any job they could get to care for their son, Narciso.\"\n\n**Overall**:\nYour essay reflects an understanding of the memoir\u2019s themes of pride and gratitude, but it requires considerable refinement to meet academic standards. Focus on developing a clear, precise thesis, supporting your arguments with substantial evidence and logical reasoning, and improving the overall structure and language of your writing.

While there are some references to specific passages in the memoir, they are not well integrated into the argument, and the connection between the evidence and the points being made is not sufficiently established. The structure of the essay is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of coherent flow from one idea to the next. Additionally, the use of language is basic, with limited vocabulary and several grammatical errors that detract from the overall readability and effectiveness of the essay. The narrative struggles to hold the reader's interest due to its repetitive nature and lack of engaging storytelling techniques. To improve, the essay should focus on developing a clear thesis, integrating evidence seamlessly into the argument, enhancing the logical flow with better transitions, and refining language use to be more varied and precise.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created by the author in this memoir was nostalgic. @PERSON1 remembers all the happy times he had, and memories that took place in his home. In paragraph two, he reflects back on how in his traditional Cuban home, where the heart was the kitchen. He remembers his parents love for cooking, and how eternally grateful he is it got passed down to him. @PERSON1 remembers the passionate Cuban music mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. In paragraph three and four, he tells how the\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay effectively captures the nostalgic mood of the memoir through detailed reflections on the author's memories with substantial evidence drawn directly from the text. The clear and well-supported thesis regarding the nostalgic atmosphere is consistently backed by specific examples, such as the vivid descriptions of the Cuban kitchen, the familial gatherings, and the cultural solidarity in the neighborhood. The narrative flows logically from one point to the next, with each paragraph building on the previous one to create a cohesive and compelling story. Moreover, the use of technical terminology and a varied, precise vocabulary enhances the readability and depth of the essay. The sentence structures are complex yet clear, contributing to an engaging and sophisticated writing style. Additionally, the essay maintains grammatical accuracy, with minimal errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, ensuring that the content is delivered effectively. Overall, the essay demonstrates a strong alignment with the guidelines, showcasing evidence-based arguments, logical progression, and linguistic precision.\n\n\n\n---------------------------\n\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created in the memoir is grateful. \"My Parents both shared cooking duties and unwrittingly Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today\". What I mean by that is that he is grateful for what he learned from is parents. \"I would always be grateful to my Parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the besis of my life. What I mean about that is that he loves and cherish his mom and dad for what they did for him. The mood in this memoir is grateful because he love and cherrishes and cares about his mom and dad.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the memoir's theme of gratitude, with specific references to the author\u2019s expressions of thanks toward his parents. However, the thesis statement could be more precise and clearly articulated at the beginning to anchor the reader\u2019s understanding of your main argument.\n\nYour essay structure needs improvement to ensure a logical flow of ideas. Currently, the paragraphs are somewhat disjointed, and the transitions between your points are abrupt. Consider introducing each new idea with a clear topic sentence and using transitional phrases to guide your reader smoothly from one idea to the next. \n\nFor instance, when you mention the author's gratitude for his parents' love and sacrifice, provide a specific example or quote that directly supports this point before moving on to the next piece of evidence. This will help to create a more cohesive and compelling narrative.\n\nIn terms of language and style, there are several areas where you can enhance your vocabulary to be more precise and varied. For example, instead of saying \"What I mean by that is,\" try to integrate your explanation more seamlessly into your analysis. This will make your writing more sophisticated and engaging.\n\nAdditionally, attention to grammatical accuracy is crucial. There are several grammatical errors, such as \"unwrittingly\" (which should be \"unwittingly\"), \"is parents\" (which should be \"his parents\"), \"cherrishes\" (which should be \"cherishes\"), and the inconsistent capitalization of \"Parents.\" Correcting these errors will improve the readability and professionalism of your essay.\n\nTo summarize, your essay effectively identifies the theme of gratitude, but it would benefit from a clearer thesis, smoother transitions, more precise language, and meticulous attention to grammatical conventions. Keep refining your writing to develop a strong, evidence-based argument with logical structure and technical precision.",

I think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. A computer can be used for communication, education, and for accessing important information quickly, such as the local news. Now, let me tell you why computers are good for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a friend who I was very close to and a part of his life. Unfortunately, he had to move away. But I still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while. A convenient way to do this was by using a computer. The computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can @CAPS5 stay in touch. Different types of communication on the computer can be e-mail, instant-messaging, video chat, online chat groups...etc. This helps people stay connected. That's why I think communication is the biggest effect on people due to the use of a computer. But, a computer can also be used for learning. At school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals. For example when my class researched different things about the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, our main source of infromation was the internet on our computers. We researched the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. Also, kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it.

It's a good way to educate everyone although the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information. \"@CAPS6 and adults often check their e-mail and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy, \"says expert @PERSON1.

If few people disapprove of a particular material, the book remains in most shelves uncensored. When a lot of people begin to protest that same material, it has a high probability of being banned. With this process, every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not removed, while the ones that truly deserve it are removed.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Your essay on the censorship and removal of materials from libraries makes a compelling argument, effectively capturing the reader's attention with clear points of view and logical reasoning. Your stance is well-articulated, and the balance you strike between the necessity of some censorship while advocating for the protection of literary works is commendable.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Thesis and Argumentation:**\n   - Your thesis is clear and concise, establishing the main argument that the current system of censorship should continue with some modifications. This is a strong foundation for the rest of your essay.\n   - The arguments are supported by logical reasoning and examples, such as the need for parental permission to access certain materials and the historical context of racial slurs in literature. These points strengthen your argument by providing concrete evidence and context.\n\n2. **Personal Connection and Emotional Appeal:**\n   - You've effectively used personal anecdotes, such as the layout of offensive material in your local library, to make your argument more relatable and emotionally resonant. This approach helps to engage the reader on a deeper emotional level.\n\n3. **Logical Flow and Organization:**\n   - The essay is well-organized, with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. Each paragraph transitions smoothly to the next, maintaining a logical flow that enhances the readability and emotional impact of your writing.\n\n4. **Expressive Language and Style:**\n   - Your language and style are expressive and varied, which keeps the reader engaged. The use of emotive vocabulary and varied sentence structures helps convey your message effectively.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Development of Arguments:**\n   - While your arguments are clear, some points could benefit from further development. For instance, the section discussing the historical context of racial slurs could delve deeper into why this context is important for modern readers to understand, enhancing the emotional resonance of your argument.\n\n2. **Clarity and Precision:**\n   - There are a few areas where clarity could be improved. For example, the sentence \"When a high percentage of people join that cause, then it should be banned\" could be made more precise by specifying what \"high percentage\" means. This would make your argument more concrete and understandable.\n\n3. **Grammar and Conventions:**\n   - Pay attention to minor grammatical errors and typos, such as \"their is\" instead of \"there is\" and \"offensve\" instead of \"offensive.\" These small mistakes can detract from the readability and overall effectiveness of your writing.\n\n4. **Emotional Depth:**\n   - While you've included some personal anecdotes, consider adding more emotional depth by reflecting on how censorship and banned books have personally affected you or those around you. This could enhance the emotional connection between your writing and the reader.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOverall, your essay effectively communicates a balanced perspective on library censorship, supported by clear arguments and personal anecdotes. By further developing your points, ensuring clarity and precision, and adding more emotional depth, you can",

However, it falls short in terms of depth and emotional resonance. The essay lacks specific personal anecdotes and vivid emotional appeals that would make the narrative more engaging and impactful. The connection between the flower and the narrator's determination is not fully fleshed out, leaving the reader wanting more insight into the narrator's feelings and motivations. Additionally, the structure of the essay is quite simplistic, with a series of events listed without much coherence or fluid transitions, which detracts from the overall flow. The language used is basic and does not capture the emotional intensity or expressiveness expected in a high-scoring essay. While there are minimal grammatical errors, the vocabulary is limited and repetitive, which affects the overall readability and engagement.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay on \"Rough Road Ahead\" by Joe Kurmaskie offers a good start in discussing how the setting impacts the cyclist. You've pinpointed some crucial elements like the desert environment, the dwindling water supply, and the emotional toll on the cyclist. However, there are several areas where you can delve deeper to enhance both the emotional and technical aspects of your writing.\n\n1. **Emotional Depth and Personal Connection:**\n   - You've highlighted the cyclist's physical struggle, but I'd like to see more about his emotional journey. How did encountering the ghost town make him feel? Despair? Fear? Isolation? Try to explore these emotions with evocative language that brings the reader into his experience.\n\n2. **Clarity and Detail:**\n   - Your main ideas are clear, but they need more detailed support. For example, the water pump producing a tar-like substance is intriguing\u2014how did this affect him both physically and emotionally? Adding sensory details (sight, smell, taste) can make your narrative more vivid and impactful.\n\n3. **Structure and Flow:**\n   - The essay could benefit from smoother transitions between ideas. Instead of listing events, try to weave them together into a cohesive narrative. This will help maintain the reader's engagement and make your essay more compelling.\n\n4. **Technical Precision:**\n   - There are some grammatical errors and misspellings that need attention. For example, \"raod\" should be \"road,\" \"emicated\" should be \"emaciated,\" and \"he water supply\" should be \"his water supply.\" These errors can distract from the overall readability of your essay.\n\n5. **Thesis Development:**\n   - Your concluding sentence, \"That is how the feature affected the setting,\" feels abrupt and somewhat off-target. Instead, consider a more reflective ending that ties back to your thesis and highlights the lasting impact of the setting on the cyclist\u2019s journey. This will provide a stronger closure to your essay.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n- **Emotive Language:** Use more descriptive and emotive language to highlight the cyclist's feelings. Words like \"desperation,\" \"hopelessness,\" and \"relief\" can add emotional depth.\n- **Personal Anecdotes:** Add more personal anecdotes or reflections from the cyclist. For instance, you could describe a moment when he almost gave up hope and what kept him going.\n- **Variety and Complexity:** Vary your sentence structures to avoid repetition and add complexity. This will make your writing more engaging and dynamic.\n- **Revision:** Take the time to revise and proofread your essay. This will help catch any errors and refine your ideas for greater clarity and impact.\n\nYou're on the right track, and with a bit more effort in these areas, your essay can become a powerful and emotionally resonant piece. Keep pushing yourself to explore deeper emotions and to articulate them clearly, and your writing will continue to improve. I'm looking forward to seeing your revisions!",

        "llmResponse": "Your essay offers a foundational understanding of the challenges the cyclist faced in the desert, highlighting the intense heat and the abandonment of the towns he passed through. However, to truly engage your reader and create a lasting emotional impact, let's delve deeper into how these elements affected the cyclist both physically and emotionally.\n\nFirst, consider expanding on the emotional and physical hardships the cyclist endured. Describe his feelings of isolation and desperation as he rode through the abandoned towns, perhaps drawing on personal experiences or imaginative scenarios to create a more vivid and relatable narrative.\n\nFor example, you might write, \"Imagine the overwhelming sense of loneliness and despair as the cyclist pedals through ghost towns, the silence only broken by the occasional rustle of tumbleweeds. Each drop of sweat is a reminder of his vulnerability, intensifying his fear that he might not make it out of the desert alive.\"\n\nIn terms of technical aspects, your essay would benefit from varied sentence structures to maintain reader engagement. The current sentences are quite straightforward; by incorporating more complex sentences and descriptive language, you can elevate your writing. For instance, instead of \"The month was June a hot month and the sun was beating down on him,\" you could write, \"In the scorching heat of June, the relentless sun bore down on him, each ray feeling like a searing reminder of his dwindling strength.\"\n\nAdditionally, ensure that your transitions between sentences and ideas are smooth to maintain a logical flow. This can be achieved by connecting the emotional and physical impacts more cohesively. For instance, following the sentence about the lack of water, you might add, \"With each arid breath, the cyclist's throat grew drier, his hope diminishing with every passing mile as he struggled to find any sign of life in the barren landscape.\"\n\nYour narrative holds potential, and with these enhancements, you can create a more emotionally resonant and impactful piece. Remember, writing is an evolving process, and with each revision, your ability to connect deeply with your emotions and those of your readers will grow stronger. Keep exploring and reflecting on the emotional experiences you wish to convey, and don't hesitate to seek personalized guidance during one-on-one sessions. You have the ability to make your writing truly resonate with your readers.",

Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion about what the book is convincing readers?     I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self. But if I have the right to remove that book from the self- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the self for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from the arthur, Katherine Paterson, from my opinion, I believe that what she is saying is very true. Considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things, if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the self, there would not be a varity of books for people to choose from. I have sometimes gotten corious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book. They either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible. Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good. So if they had the right to remove that book I would have never got the chance to read that book.

Lastly, refining your vocabulary and sentence structures will help to articulate your arguments more convincingly and maintain the reader's interest throughout.\n\n\n\n---------------------------\n\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Do you think that certain materials should be removed off library's bookselfs if someone dislikes or does not agree with the topic or the plot? Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion about what the book is convincing readers?     I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self. But if I have the right to remove that book from the self- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the self for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from the arthur, Katherine Paterson, from my opinion, I believe that what she is saying is very true. Considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things, if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the self, there would not be a varity of books for people to choose from. I have sometimes gotten corious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book. They either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible. Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good. So if they had the right to remove that book I would have never got the chance to read that book.     I do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelfs just on their specific personality. Everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books. Everyone should get a large variety\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Your essay tackles the important and timely issue of censorship in libraries, specifically addressing whether materials should be removed based on individual opinions. You present a clear stance on the matter, emphasizing that everyone should have the freedom to choose whether or not to engage with certain materials. This is a well-chosen and relevant topic for discussion, and your main argument is quite clear.\n\nHowever, there are several areas where your essay could be strengthened to enhance its clarity, logical flow, and grammatical precision. Below are some specific suggestions and points of improvement:\n\n1. **Thesis Statement:**\n   Your thesis should be clear and direct, ideally placed at the end of your introductory paragraph to set the stage for your argument. Consider revising it to something like, \"I believe that materials should not be removed from public libraries simply because some individuals find them offensive, as this would limit the availability and diversity of resources for others.\"\n\n2. **Clarity and Precision:**\n   - In your opening questions, be sure to use correct and precise wording. For example, \"Do you think certain materials should be removed from library bookshelves if someone dislikes or disagrees with the topic or plot?\"\n   - Replace \"bookselfs\" with \"bookshelves\" and \"remove off\" with simply \"remove.\"\n\n3. **Quote Integration:**\n   - The quote from Katherine Paterson should be integrated smoothly into your essay. Ensure proper punctuation and citation: \"As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf\u2014that work I abhor\u2014then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the shelf for any of us.'\"\n   - After the quote, provide a more detailed analysis to explain its relevance to your argument.\n\n4. **Grammar and Syntax:**\n   - Correct spelling errors such as \"bookselfs\" (should be \"bookshelves\"), \"varity\" (should be \"variety\"), \"corious\" (should be \"curious\"), and \"shelfs\" (should be \"shelves\").\n   - Ensure subject-verb agreement throughout your essay. For instance, \"Every person has the choice to not read a book\" instead of \"every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive.\"\n\n5. **Logical Flow and Transitions:**\n   - Your essay would benefit from smoother transitions between paragraphs and ideas. For instance, after discussing the general principle of personal choice, you could introduce the quote with a transitional phrase like, \"As Katherine Paterson eloquently illustrates...\"\n   - Ensure each paragraph flows logically to the next. For example, after discussing your friend's reading preferences, explain how this personal anecdote supports your broader argument against censorship.\n\n6. **Supporting Details:**",

I know I sure wouldn't.     Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society. It can be found nearly anywhere. In books, magazines, @CAPS1 shows, movies, on the @CAPS2, you name it. All of these are easily accessible by children of all ages. That is why there should be censorship of certain materials, to a certain degree. By this, I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library, it should only be able to be\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay provides a compelling argument for the necessity of censorship to protect children from inappropriate content. The thesis is clear and grammatically correct, establishing a strong foundation for your viewpoint. The development of your argument is consistent, using grammatically precise sentences to emphasize the dangers of exposing young children to explicit material. The conclusion effectively reinforces the thesis, summarizing the key points made throughout the essay. The organization of the essay is commendable, with each paragraph logically flowing into the next, guided by clear and grammatically correct transitions and topic sentences. Your word choice is varied and appropriate, enhancing the persuasiveness of your argument. The complexity and correctness of your sentence structures further contribute to the overall readability and impact of the essay. Additionally, the essay demonstrates strong control of standard writing conventions, with minimal errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Overall, your writing is clear, focused, and engaging, adhering to grammatical conventions and displaying a logical and effective organization.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Have you ever watched or seen a book or even a movie that you do not think kids should be reading or watching?

However, it suffers from several issues that impact its overall effectiveness. The clarity of the thesis could be improved, as it feels somewhat scattered and not grammatically polished. The arguments in support of the main idea are present but are overly simplistic and repetitive, lacking the depth and precise language needed to fully engage the reader. Additionally, the organization of the essay is quite weak, with paragraphs that do not follow a clear, logical structure and transitions that are often awkward or missing altogether. The word choice and sentence structures are basic and exhibit numerous grammatical errors, including spelling mistakes (\"childern,\" \"apporaite,\" \"differnet\") and incorrect usage of words. These issues detract from the readability and overall impact of the essay.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay presents a passionate perspective on the importance of upholding freedom of speech and the role of parents in monitoring the content their children are exposed to. However, there are several areas that need significant improvement to enhance the clarity, grammatical accuracy, and overall effectiveness of your argument.\n\nFirstly, your thesis statement is somewhat unclear and grammatically incorrect. It would be beneficial to structure your thesis in a more precise and concise manner to clearly express your main argument. For example, \u201cWhile it is essential to protect children from inappropriate content, this should be achieved through ratings and parental guidance rather than censorship, to uphold freedom of speech.\u201d\n\nThe essay contains numerous grammatical errors, including issues with spelling (\"rateing,\" \"takeing,\" \"speach,\" \"faught,\" \"violance,\" \"inapprotive,\" \"montoired,\" \"fource,\" \"certion,\" \"responseabitly,\" \"speacking,\" \"infourceing,\" \"selfs,\" \"imagary\"), punctuation, and capitalization. It is crucial to proofread your work carefully and correct these errors to enhance readability and overall quality.\n\nYour arguments are often repeated and lack the depth needed to fully engage the reader. Please work on developing your points further with precise language and concrete examples. For instance, instead of repeating that inappropriate content should not be censored, elaborate on how parental guidance and proper ratings systems can effectively prevent children from accessing such content.\n\nThe organization of the essay is weak. Your paragraphs do not follow a clear, logical structure, and transitions between ideas are often awkward or missing entirely. For a more coherent argument, ensure that each paragraph focuses on a single point that supports your thesis, and use clear topic sentences and transitions to guide the reader through your essay.\n\nYour word choice and sentence structures are quite basic and often incorrect. Aim to vary your vocabulary and use more complex sentence structures to convey your ideas more effectively. This will also help in maintaining the reader's interest and enhancing the overall persuasiveness of your essay.\n\nAdditionally, the conclusion should not only summarize your main points but also synthesize your arguments to leave a lasting impression. Consider restating your thesis in a new light based on the arguments presented and perhaps propose a call to action or a solution.\n\nFor instance:\n\"In conclusion, the freedom of speech is a fundamental right that should be preserved. Through effective rating systems and active parental involvement, we can protect children from inappropriate content without resorting to censorship. By doing so, we honor the sacrifices made for our freedoms and ensure a balanced approach to content consumption.\"\n\nLastly, please ensure your essay maintains grammatical precision, correct spelling, punctuation, and capitalization throughout. This adherence to language conventions is crucial for clear communication and effective argumentation.\n\nOverall, your essay's intent is clear, but it requires significant refinement in clarity, grammatical accuracy, organization, and language use to meet the standards of effective communication and persuasive writing. Keep working on these areas, and do not hesitate to ask questions if you encounter any difficulties.",

The thesis statement is vague and not clearly defined. The essay attempts to discuss how the setting affects the cyclist but lacks specific examples and detailed support from the text, resulting in a superficial response. Many sentences are grammatically incorrect or fragmented, which makes the narrative disjointed and difficult to follow. The organization is weak, with an unclear structure that lacks smooth transitions between ideas. There are numerous spelling and punctuation errors, which further impede readability. Overall, the essay fails to effectively communicate its points due to insufficient content development and weak language control.

I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon telling\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic understanding of how the features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist, but it lacks depth and specificity in its analysis. The thesis is not entirely clear and could benefit from a more precise statement. The development of arguments includes some examples from the memoir, but these are not thoroughly analyzed or integrated into a cohesive argument. The writing demonstrates frequent grammatical errors, such as \"alot of doubt\" instead of \"a lot of doubt,\" and issues with sentence structure that impede readability. The organization shows potential but needs clearer, more grammatically correct transitions and topic sentences to enhance the logical flow. The language used is somewhat repetitive and lacks variety, which diminishes the overall impact.

The thesis statement is present but not clearly articulated, and the sentences contain numerous grammatical errors that detract from the overall clarity and readability. The development and support of arguments are weak, with limited evidence from the memoir to substantiate the points made. Additionally, the conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis. Organization is lacking as the essay jumps from one point to another without clear transitions or topic sentences, making it difficult to follow the narrative. The language and style are also problematic, with a limited vocabulary and repetitive sentence structures that do not enhance the essay's persuasiveness.

        "llmResponse": "The essay addresses the prompt by discussing how the setting affects the cyclist in \"Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.\" While there are some promising aspects, several areas need significant improvement to align with our class goals.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Topic Introduction:** The essay starts by identifying the role of the setting in the cyclist's journey.\n2. **Engagement:** The text attempts to describe the setting and its impact on the cyclist, showing engagement with the material.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n1. **Thesis Statement:**\n   - The thesis is not clearly articulated. A more precise thesis would help to set a clear direction for your essay. Consider rephrasing it to something like: \"The diverse terrains encountered by the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit' significantly impact his journey, exacerbating his physical and mental challenges.\"\n\n2. **Grammatical Precision:**\n   - There are several grammatical errors that need attention. For example, \"his working his way\" should be \"he is working his way,\" and \"diffrent\" should be \"different.\" Careful proofreading is essential.\n   - Punctuation around the title should be consistent. Ensure you use proper quotation marks: \u201cRough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.\u201d\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Clarity:**\n   - Sentences such as \"The terrain was a lot diffrent with rolling hills and tumbleweed rolling by and a snake\" are somewhat fragmented and need clearer structure. Try: \"The terrain became more challenging, characterized by rolling hills, tumbleweeds, and even the occasional snake.\"\n   - Avoid run-on sentences. For example, \"Through listening to the old men the cyclist almost died from the threatening heat and lack of water\" could be broken down for clarity: \"By following the advice of the old men, the cyclist encountered severe heat and a lack of water, which nearly resulted in his death.\"\n\n4. **Evidence and Support:**\n   - The essay needs more detailed support from the text. For instance, when discussing the abandoned towns, provide specific descriptions or quotes from the memoir to substantiate your points.\n   - The essay should delve deeper into how the setting specifically impacts the cyclist's mental and physical states, rather than just stating that it does.\n\n5. **Organization and Logical Flow:**\n   - Your paragraphs should have clear topic sentences that introduce the main idea of the paragraph. Transitions between ideas need to be more fluid to ensure a logical progression.\n   - The conclusion is somewhat abrupt. Summarize the main points and reinforce how the setting critically affects the cyclist, tying back to your refined thesis. For example: \"In conclusion, the varying terrains the cyclist encounters not only challenge his physical endurance but also push him to the brink of survival, highlighting the merciless nature of his journey.\"\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n- **Thesis Development:** Start",

The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability.

The thesis is not clearly stated, making it difficult for readers to understand the main argument. The development of ideas is minimal and somewhat confusing. For example, instead of explaining why the author concluded the story with a statement about a new beginning, the essay drifts into discussing various unrelated aspects. Grammatical errors such as \"about,\" \"is,\" \"desrves,\" and inconsistent verb tenses detract significantly from the readability and flow of the essay. Additionally, the sentence structures are not varied, and the vocabulary is simple and often used incorrectly, leading to a monotonous tone. The paragraph lacks proper transitions, making it disjointed and hard to follow. There is also a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points made, which weakens the overall argument. For future improvement, the writer should focus on crafting a clear thesis, using varied and precise language, and providing specific examples to support their arguments, all while maintaining grammatical accuracy.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succed, one must keep trying.

Saeng will retry her driver\u0092s test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided lacks clarity and is fraught with grammatical errors, which significantly impede its readability and effectiveness. The thesis statement is somewhat unclear, and the supporting sentences contain numerous mistakes, reducing the impact of the arguments presented. Consequently, the essay does not adequately address the prompt, nor does it remain focused on any coherent argument about Saeng's adaptation to her new country. The sentences are often incomplete or awkwardly structured, further detracting from the essay's overall readability. Additionally, the essay lacks a logical flow, with transitions that are neither smooth nor grammatically correct. The conclusion is abrupt and fails to effectively summarize the thesis, leaving the reader with an incomplete understanding of the author's main points. Improvements in grammatical accuracy, clearer thesis articulation, better organizational structure, and more precise language usage are needed to enhance the quality and coherence of this essay.\n\n\n\n---------------------------\n\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: In the story \"Winter Hibiscus\", the author concluded the story with the quote \"when they come back, Saeng's vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.\" the auther put this paragraph as the concluding thought to stress that Saeng is determined to make a change. She failed the test but wants to take it again. Her grandmother's resemblance is in the flower so if the flower budds, then her grandmother will be back in a sense. When he grandmother \"comes back\" then @PERSON1 will feel as if her grandmother is giving her strength and encouragement to try the test again.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Your essay makes a commendable effort to engage with the text and the prompt. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and grammatical precision.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis is somewhat implicit and lacks clarity. It is important to explicitly state the main argument of your essay in a clear and grammatically correct thesis statement. For example, \"The author concludes the story with this quote to emphasize Saeng's determination to change and her emotional connection to her grandmother through the hibiscus flower.\"\n\n2. **Grammatical Precision**: There are multiple grammatical errors that need attention. For instance, \"auther\" should be \"author,\" \"budds\" should be \"buds,\" and \"then @PERSON1\" seems to be a placeholder or error that needs correction. Ensure you proofread your work for such mistakes to maintain readability.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure**: Some sentences are awkwardly structured, impacting the flow of your essay. For example, \"Her grandmother's resemblance is in the flower so if the flower budds, then her grandmother will be back in a sense\" can be rephrased for clarity: \"The hibiscus flower symbolizes her grandmother, so when it buds, Saeng feels as if her grandmother is with her, providing strength and encouragement.\" \n\n4. **Supporting Arguments**: Your supporting arguments are present but need more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text. Expanding on how the hibiscus flower represents her grandmother and how it motivates Saeng would strengthen your essay.\n\n5. **Logical Flow**: The essay should have a logical progression of ideas. Ensure smooth transitions between sentences and paragraphs to create a coherent narrative. For instance, after discussing the symbolism of the hibiscus, transition smoothly into how this symbolism impacts Saeng's determination.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The conclusion should succinctly summarize the main points and reinforce the thesis. Rather than ending abruptly, tie your arguments back to the thesis to leave a lasting impression on the reader.\n\nHere's a revised version of your concluding sentences to illustrate these points:\n\n\"The author concludes the story with this quote to emphasize Saeng's determination to change and her emotional connection to her grandmother through the hibiscus flower. Despite failing the test initially, Saeng resolves to try again, drawing strength from the symbolic rebirth of the hibiscus, which represents her grandmother's enduring presence and encouragement. This connection empowers Saeng to face new challenges with renewed confidence.\"\n\nOverall, focusing on these areas will significantly enhance the clarity, coherence, and grammatical precision of your essay. Keep up the effort, and don't hesitate to seek feedback and ask questions if you encounter difficulties.",

The overall message is somewhat muddled due to confusing syntax and word choice, which detracts from the intended emphasis on the author's memories of her homeland. The paragraph could benefit from more precise language and a clearer connection between the memories evoked by the spring season and the author's decision to retake her driving test. Additionally, the development of the argument lacks coherence, with details about animals and blossoming trees feeling tangential and underdeveloped. The organization is also weak, as transitions between sentences are abrupt, making the narrative hard to follow. Furthermore, grammatical errors such as \"memoreies,\" \"beautifu,\" and several awkward phrasings, impede readability and distract from the content. To improve, the essay should focus on refining sentence structures, ensuring grammatical accuracy, and creating a more logical flow of ideas to effectively convey the emotional significance of the author's memories.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it\u0092s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay presents an attempt to engage with the prompt, but it requires considerable refinement in terms of clarity, structure, and depth. Let's work through these issues systematically.\n\n1. **Clarity and Precision**:\n   - Your thesis statement, which suggests that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it \"grabs your attention\" and shows determination, lacks specificity and depth. A thesis should clearly state the main argument and provide a roadmap for the reader.\n   - For example, you could refine your thesis to something like: \"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to highlight the protagonist's determination and resilience, symbolizing her readiness to embrace new challenges.\"\n\n2. **Development of Ideas**:\n   - Your supporting arguments need more elaboration and textual evidence. Simply stating that the paragraph \"grabs your attention\" and \"shows that the girl is determined\" is not enough. Explain how the paragraph achieves these effects and why they are significant.\n   - Consider discussing specific elements of the paragraph, such as language, imagery, or symbolism, that contribute to the reader's understanding of the protagonist's determination.\n\n3. **Coherence and Structure**:\n   - The essay is quite brief and lacks a clear, logical structure. Develop your argument in a more organized manner, starting with a strong thesis statement, followed by well-supported body paragraphs, and concluding with a summary that ties everything back to your thesis.\n   - Use transitions between sentences and paragraphs to improve the flow of your writing. For instance, phrases like \"Furthermore,\" \"Additionally,\" and \"In conclusion,\" can help guide the reader through your arguments.\n\n4. **Language and Vocabulary**:\n   - Your language and vocabulary are quite basic. Aim to use varied and precise language to make your essay more engaging and sophisticated.\n   - For example, instead of saying \"grabs your attention a little bit,\" you might say, \"captures the reader's attention effectively.\"\n\n5. **Grammar and Mechanics**:\n   - There are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that need correction. For instance, \"its\" should be \"it's,\" and \"determind\" should be \"determined.\"\n   - Ensure that your sentences are grammatically accurate and punctuated correctly. Proofreading your work before submission can help catch these errors.\n\nIn summary, your essay would benefit from a clearer thesis, more detailed development of ideas, improved coherence, varied vocabulary, and grammatical accuracy. By addressing these areas, you can create a more compelling and precise argument that effectively conveys your insights into the concluding paragraph of the story. Keep up the effort, and don't hesitate to seek further clarification or assistance if needed.",

        "llmResponse": "Your essay attempts to address why the author concluded \"Winter Hibiscus\" with the chosen paragraph, but it struggles with clarity and grammatical precision, which are crucial in conveying your ideas effectively.\n\nFirstly, your thesis statement needs to be clearer. While you mention that the conclusion has a \"touching\" effect and sums up the points discussed in the story, these ideas are not articulated with the precision required for a strong thesis. Consider revising your thesis to explicitly state why the author\u2019s conclusion is impactful and how it ties together the themes of the story.\n\nYour supporting arguments present some interesting observations, but they are hindered by grammatical errors and inconsistent punctuation. For example, in the sentence \u201cIn this unique quote, the author demonstrates imagery by giving you a mental picture of a silent lonly girl nealing down in the cold garden, whispering silently to herself,\u201d there are several misspellings (\"lonely,\" \"kneeling\") and redundancies (\"whispering silently\"). Such errors detract from the strength of your analysis. Aim for varied sentence structures and precise language to enhance readability.\n\nThe paragraph also lacks smooth transitions between ideas, leading to a somewhat fragmented reading experience. For instance, you jump from discussing imagery to summarizing the story without a clear transition. Using transitional phrases can help guide the reader through your argument more coherently.\n\nMoreover, your conclusion feels rushed and does not effectively summarize your main points or tie them back to the thesis. Instead of simply restating what you previously mentioned, strive to synthesize your arguments, emphasizing how they collectively support your thesis.\n\nTo improve, focus on the following:\n1. **Clear Thesis**: Clearly state your main argument in the introduction.\n2. **Grammatical Precision**: Pay attention to spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure.\n3. **Logical Flow**: Use transitions to connect your ideas smoothly.\n4. **Varied Vocabulary**: Employ a range of vocabulary to avoid repetition and maintain reader engagement.\n5. **Conclusion**: Summarize your main arguments and tie them back to your thesis for a strong finish.\n\nFor example, you might revise part of the paragraph to something like this: \n\n\"The concluding paragraph of 'Winter Hibiscus' leaves a lasting impression by encapsulating the story\u2019s central themes and evoking a profound emotional response. The imagery in the phrase 'Saeng vowed silently to herself' vividly portrays a solitary, reflective moment, enhancing the reader\u2019s connection to Saeng's inner journey. Additionally, the author\u2019s reference to the hibiscus and geese effectively ties together key motifs from the story, illustrating Saeng's growth and determination to adapt to her new life.\"\n\nBy addressing these areas, your essay will become clearer, more precise, and more compelling. Keep up the effort, and continue to refine your writing skills. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask!",

The narrative effectively evokes a warm and comforting mood, supported by specific examples from the memoir. However, there are several grammatical errors and inconsistencies that detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. For instance, the use of \"@CAPS1\" appears to be a placeholder or redaction, which disrupts the flow of the text and makes it difficult to follow.

Additionally, the sentences are grammatically correct but often simplistic and repetitive, leading to a lack of complexity and variation in word choice and sentence structure. The organization of the essay is weak, with transitions and topic sentences that do not effectively guide the reader through the argument. Furthermore, there are noticeable errors in spelling and punctuation, which detract from the overall quality of the writing.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay successfully captures the essence of the memoir, emphasizing the themes of contentment and happiness within the context of Narciso's Cuban home. The vivid description of cultural elements like music, traditional cooking, and family ambiance offers a compelling portrayal of the author's experiences. However, there are several areas that require attention to improve clarity, structure, and grammatical accuracy.\n\nFirst, let's address the thesis statement in your opening sentence. While it introduces the challenges of living away from one's home country, it is somewhat vague and could be more precise. Consider specifying how the memoir demonstrates the contrasting elements of difficulty and happiness.\n\nFor example:\n\"Living away from one's home country can present significant challenges, including poverty and discrimination, yet Narciso Rodriguez's memoir beautifully illustrates how contentment and cultural richness can flourish despite these adversities.\"\n\nNext, your sentences occasionally lack grammatical precision and coherence, which can confuse the reader. For instance, \"Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally\" is awkwardly phrased. It would be clearer to write:\n\"Poverty often dominates the situation, accompanied by occasional racism and discrimination.\"\n\nMoreover, the transition between the first and second sentences could be smoother to ensure a logical flow of ideas. Additionally, phrases like \"lightens up\" should be replaced with more precise language to maintain an academic tone. Consider rephrasing it to:\n\"This quote illuminates the memoir's central theme, illustrating how people from various backgrounds came together to celebrate life's joys despite facing societal challenges.\"\n\nYour vocabulary choice is generally good, but there are instances of repetitive language and simplistic word choices. Try to diversify your vocabulary to make the essay more engaging. For example, instead of \"best of all ambiance of family being around,\" you could write \"most notably, the warm and inviting ambiance created by the presence of family.\"\n\nFinally, there are a few punctuation errors and sentence structure issues. Ensure that all sentences are complete and avoid run-ons. For example:\n\"In the home, he still got to experience Cuban culture including music, traditional cooking and best of all ambiance of family being around.\"\nCould be improved to:\n\"In his home, Narciso continued to experience Cuban culture, including music, traditional cooking, and, most importantly, the warm ambiance created by his family.\"\n\nIn summary, your essay provides a heartfelt and vivid account of the memoir, but it would benefit greatly from a more precise thesis statement, improved sentence structure, varied vocabulary, and careful attention to grammatical accuracy. Keep up the good work, and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions as you revise.",

        "llmResponse": "Your essay demonstrates a genuine engagement with the memoir and effectively conveys a range of emotions experienced by the author. However, there are several areas that need improvement to enhance clarity, grammatical accuracy, and overall coherence.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement and Structure**: \n   - Your opening thesis statement is somewhat unclear. For instance, \"The author creates a very happy, but curious mood towards the reader\" can be rephrased for better precision. Consider something like, \"The author evokes a complex mood, blending happiness with curiosity and sadness, to illustrate the profound sacrifices made by Narciso's parents.\"\n\n2. **Supporting Arguments and Evidence**: \n   - While you provide examples from the text, your arguments can be better developed. For example, after quoting \"start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find,\" you might delve deeper into the significance of this struggle and how it shapes the overall mood of the memoir.\n   - Avoid vague references like \"@LOCATION1\" and \"@MONTH1.\" Specify actual details to strengthen your argument.\n\n3. **Grammar and Punctuation**: \n   - There are several grammatical errors that need addressing. For example, \"Narciso mom\" should be \"Narciso's mom,\" and \"Studied\" should be \"studied.\" Ensure proper noun capitalization and possessive forms are correctly used.\n   - Punctuation needs attention, particularly around quotations. For example, \"Back in Cuba, 'Narciso, Sr., had worked...'\" should be better integrated into your sentence structure.\n\n4. **Sentence Structure and Clarity**: \n   - Some sentences are overly complex and would benefit from simplification and clearer structure. For example, \"The reading made me happy for Narciso, but curious on how much his parents had to struggle to give Narciso the best life he could get\" could be refined to: \"The memoir made me happy for Narciso but also curious about the extent of his parents' struggles to provide him with a better life.\"\n\n5. **Emotional Impact**: \n   - You effectively convey the emotional impact of the memoir, but ensure your expressions are precise and grammatically correct. For instance, \"This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again\" could be improved to: \"This evoked sadness as it highlights the heart-wrenching decision many immigrants face, leaving behind parents, friends, and the possibility of never seeing them again.\"\n\n6. **Vocabulary and Word Choice**: \n   - Aim for varied and accurate vocabulary. Repetitive phrases such as \"made me\" can be replaced with more descriptive language to better articulate your reactions.\n\n**Summary and Suggestions for Improvement**:\n- Refine your thesis statement for clarity and grammatical accuracy.\n- Develop your supporting arguments with more depth and detailed evidence from the text.\n- Address grammatical errors, particularly in punctuation and possessive forms.\n- Simpl",

I say this because lots of people can talk to family of friends long distance. Also the computer can teach you lots of thing. Finally it makes you more social. In @CAPS1 strong opinion computers are better for the world. Firstly, many people can talk long distance with family of friends. You have web cam and that allows you to chat and see the person. Also @CAPS2 is another site\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and relevant thesis statement regarding the benefits of computers, and the main ideas are adequately supported with examples. However, the arguments could benefit from more specific real-world examples and pragmatic reasoning to strengthen the claims. The essay is organized with an introduction, body, and conclusion, but the transitions between paragraphs and the overall flow could be improved for a smoother reading experience. The word choice is mostly effective, conveying the intended message clearly, although some phrases lack precision and could be refined for better clarity. The sentence structures are varied but could be more fluid to enhance readability. There are minimal errors in conventions, but attention to correct usage of punctuation, spelling, and capitalization would improve the overall quality. Overall, the essay is clear and focused, but it could be enhanced with better organization, more precise language, and stronger examples to fully meet the teacher's expectations for clarity, practicality, and linguistic precision.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear Newspaper editor I would like to make @CAPS3 about the benifits of owning a computer. For example you can learn many thing you would of never of been able too, you can also go in chat rooms and talk with friends or other people and it can even make teaching esyer too. Computers in many countres are standard and we use then to learn many things but if you bring one to the tribes in @LOCATION1 it will look like a alein object but once they know how to use it it can open there eyes for ever\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay you presented demonstrates a genuine enthusiasm for the topic of the benefits of owning a computer, but it requires significant refinement in several areas to meet higher standards. The content is somewhat clear and addresses the prompt, though the examples provided are often broad and lack depth in real-world relevance. Incorporating more specific, illustrative examples would enhance the argument's effectiveness. The organization of the essay is somewhat disjointed, with ideas jumping from one to another without clear transitions or a logical flow. Improving the structure by using well-defined topic sentences and coherent transitions between paragraphs would help. \n\nIn terms of word choice, the essay frequently uses casual and imprecise language, which detracts from its persuasive power. Employing a more formal and precise vocabulary would improve readability and impact. Sentence fluency is also an issue; many sentences are awkwardly constructed and run-on, making the essay difficult to follow at times. Simplifying sentence structures and varying them would help create a smoother reading experience. Finally, conventions are a major area for improvement. The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, incorrect spelling, and improper punctuation, all of which impede readability and distract from the argument. A thorough proofreading to correct these mistakes is essential. Overall, while the essay shows promise in engaging with the topic, it needs significant work in clarity, structure, language precision, and grammatical accuracy to fully persuade the reader.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear local newspaper, I am writing this letter to you to show on how people get effected from computers.

Computer even have a positive effect on people across\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear stance on the positive effects of computers but lacks depth and specificity in its arguments. The thesis is somewhat ambiguous and repetitive, which diminishes its overall clarity and impact. There is an attempt to develop and support the thesis, but the examples provided are general and unconvincing. For instance, the discussion on hand-eye coordination is not thoroughly explained or supported with concrete evidence. The organization of the essay is basic, with a discernible introduction, body, and conclusion; however, the flow of ideas is somewhat disjointed and lacks smooth transitions. The language used is simplistic and at times redundant, which affects the precision and engagement of the writing. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors and awkward sentence constructions that impede readability. To strengthen the essay, it would benefit from a more precise thesis, richer and more specific examples, improved coherence, and careful attention to language and stylistic choices. Overall, the essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the topic but requires significant refinement to meet the teacher's expectations for clarity, practicality, and precision.\n\n\n\n---------------------------\n\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1. I am @NUM1 years old and I go to a @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 called @ORGANIZATION1. I am a really smart kid. In @CAPS1 opinion I benefit people using computers. You should keep reading @CAPS1 essay because I am going to tell you @NUM2 good reasons why I benefit people using computers. @CAPS1 first reason is they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. For example, when I am always using the computer and when I'm doing research it always gives me the ability to learn about new places and people. Another example is when ever I watch @CAPS2.V on @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says that people learn about learn about faraway places and people on the internet @PERCENT1 of the time. @CAPS1 second reason is it allows people to talk online with other people for example when I am on the computer everyday I visit @CAPS1 facebook it always gives me a chance to talk to @CAPS1 friends and other people online. Another example is when I go on a computer and I search computers.org it says that it lets people @PERCENT2 of the time talk to others online. @CAPS1 @NUM4 reason is it allows students to get information when they're doing a project. For example when I always use the @ORGANIZATION1 computers it allows me to get information for example, about @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 govina that is why I benefit people using computers. Another example is when ever I check out a magazine on computers it tells me that kids get alot of information when they're doing projects @PERCENT2 of the time. In conclusion, I benefit people using computers because they teach hand eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, it allows people to talk online with other people and it allows students to get information when they're doing projects. Those are the @NUM2 reasons why I benefit people using computers. So please the local newspaper please try to make this believable.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Dear @PERSON1,\n\nThank you for sharing your essay. It\u2019s clear that you are enthusiastic about the topic and have put thought into explaining how computers benefit people. To help you further develop your writing skills and make your argument more compelling, I'd like to offer some feedback.\n\n**Thesis and Clarity:**\nYour essay presents a clear thesis that computers benefit people, but it could be more focused. Instead of saying \"I benefit people using computers,\" which could be confusing, try rephrasing to something like, \"Computers benefit people by teaching hand-eye coordination, enabling communication, and providing access to information.\"\n\n**Support and Examples:**\nYou have provided several examples to support your points, which is excellent. However, these examples would be more effective if they included specific, real-world details. For instance, when you mention learning about new places and people, you could refer to a specific website or program that helped you gain this knowledge. Concrete examples add credibility to your arguments.\n\n**Organization and Flow:**\nYour essay is organized into an introduction, body, and conclusion, but the flow between ideas needs improvement. To enhance readability, consider using clear topic sentences for each paragraph and smoother transitions. For example:\n- \"First, computers teach hand-eye coordination. For instance, when I use educational games on the computer, I improve my coordination skills while learning.\"\n- \"Secondly, computers allow communication with others. For example, using Facebook enables me to stay in touch with friends and family.\"\n- \"Lastly, computers provide access to vast amounts of information, which is essential for school projects. For instance, using online databases helps me gather information about historical events.\"\n\n**Language and Precision:**\nYour word choice is sometimes imprecise and repetitive. Aim for varied and specific language to keep the reader engaged. Instead of saying \"it always gives me the ability to learn about new places and people,\" you could say, \"it enables me to explore diverse cultures and geographies.\"\n\n**Grammar and Conventions:**\nThere are several grammatical errors and awkward sentences that need refinement. For example, \"alot\" should be \"a lot,\" and \"learn about learn about\" is repetitive. Pay close attention to punctuation, capitalization, and spelling. Proofreading your essay or using tools like spell check can help catch these mistakes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nYour conclusion summarizes the key points well but could be stronger by reiterating the importance of these benefits in a concise manner. For example: \"In conclusion, computers are invaluable tools that enhance hand-eye coordination, enable global communication, and provide essential information for educational purposes. These benefits underscore the profound impact of computers on our daily lives.\"\n\nOverall, you\u2019ve demonstrated a good understanding of how computers benefit people. With more precise language, specific examples, and improved organization, your essay will be more persuasive and effective. Keep working on these areas, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you need further clarification.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Teacher's Name]",

If one person wants to censor something in a library, there is bound to be another person on the other side of that arguement  trying to protect that work from be taken away.  As a free country, it is every individuals right to take in whatever form of literature or music that they find pleasing, and history has shown the world that censorship leads those in power down a dark road.  The shielding of offensive materials is only necessary and fair when the young, impressionable minds of the world's youth are at stake, but once a person is old enough to make informed decisions, it should be their perrogative to choose their own material.  Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history, but necessary when protecting the young.     It is a person's right to choose what kind of literature they would like to read.  If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned.  For example take a hypothetical public library: a public library is an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music.  A great mental image of serenity and peace.  How does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves?  Suddenly right and left, books are disappearing as if by magic: a ceratin book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad.  Before long, there are not very many books left in this hypothetical library other than books for toddlers.  With this system, everyone suffers.  Everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to.  It would all just be simpler if book were just not banned from libraries.     History has given the world many a cruel dictator.  Oftentimes, once he comes to power, he is not the most popular of governmental forms.  To keep his subjects underneath his rule, often he has to resort to taking away civil rights.  This could be a curfew, fake elections, or censorship.  If the ruler has the power of censorship, he or she can control what the public thinks, feels, and believes.  With this power over them, the people are weakened and often abused.  Now imagine that censorship occuring in a country that has civil rights.  People would not stand for it.  So why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom?  There is absolutely no need for censorship to occur, and as history has shown, it certainly is not a good thing.     Censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights.  There is, however, one other element at play here: protection of youth and innocence.  Almost everyone can remember a time a child when they were young and innocent, free of worry and trouble.  That can disappear in a instant.  Children should not be exposed to things that are innappropriate for their age.  Nearly every movie nowadays has violent and risque, if not full-blown-adult, materials present in it.  The age of innocence is getting younger every generation, and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point.  A claim like this @MONTH1 sound hypotcritical coming from the mouth of one against censorship, but it is not 'censorship' when one is protecting the young.      Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children.  It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon.  The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people.  Also, children should be protected, and that is not censorship.  Censorship solves no problems, but it makes everyone unhappy.  Therefore, why censor",

The main ideas are overly broad and repetitive, failing to engage the reader or provide strong support for the thesis. The essay's organization is weak, with a loose structure that lacks clear transitions and well-defined topic sentences, making it challenging to follow the author's train of thought. The word choice is often inappropriate and imprecise, using informal and incorrect terms such as \"tooken.\" The sentence fluency is mechanical, with awkward constructions that impede readability. Furthermore, the essay contains several grammatical errors, including incorrect verb tense and punctuation issues, which detract from its overall effectiveness. To improve, the author should focus on developing a clear, concise thesis and supporting it with relevant, well-organized arguments and real-world examples. Additionally, attention should be given to refining sentence structure and word choice, as well as proofreading for grammatical accuracy.\n\n\n\n---------------------------\n\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Does censorship solve any problems?

        "llmResponse": "Your essay on censorship presents a compelling argument but requires more clarity and organization to fully articulate your points. Here are some areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Clear Thesis Statement:**\n   - Your thesis is somewhat buried in the text. Try to state it more explicitly in the introduction to guide the reader from the beginning. For example, \"Censorship is generally unacceptable because it infringes on personal rights and has historically led to oppression, except when used to protect children.\"\n\n2. **Logical Organization:**\n   - Your essay would benefit from clearer organization. Each paragraph should begin with a strong topic sentence that outlines the main idea. For example, your second paragraph could start with, \"Censorship in public libraries undermines the fundamental right to access diverse literature.\"\n\n3. **Practical Language and Real-World Examples:**\n   - You have a good start with your hypothetical public library example, but it could be more detailed. Perhaps compare a real-world instance where censorship led to a significant loss of literary freedom, such as the banning of certain books in historical contexts.\n   - Similarly, when discussing dictators, mentioning specific events or figures (e.g., Nazi Germany\u2019s book burnings) would add weight to your argument.\n\n4. **Transitions and Coherence:**\n   - Your ideas need smoother transitions. For example, the shift from the discussion on public libraries to historical dictatorships is quite abrupt. Use transitional phrases to guide the reader through your arguments seamlessly.\n\n5. **Word Choice and Grammar:**\n   - Pay attention to spelling and word choice. For instance, \"ceratin\" should be \"certain,\" and \"perrogative\" should be \"prerogative.\"\n   - Ensure you use formal language throughout. Words like \"risque\" should be replaced with \"inappropriate\" or \"explicit\" to maintain a professional tone.\n\n6. **Depth and Specificity:**\n   - While your argument about protecting children is valid, it needs more depth. Explain why protecting children is not considered censorship and provide examples of effective age-appropriate guidelines.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Your conclusion should reiterate your main points clearly and concisely. Summarize why censorship is generally harmful and restate the exception for protecting the youth with a strong closing statement.\n\n**Revised Example:**\n\n\"Does censorship solve any problems? Generally, censorship infringes on personal rights and has historically led to oppression, except when used to protect children. As a free country, it is every individual's right to access literature and music of their choice. History has shown that censorship leads to tyranny, and thus it should be avoided, except when safeguarding young minds. \n\nPublic libraries are meant to be places of learning and enjoyment for people of all backgrounds. If books are removed due to subjective disapproval, it undermines this purpose. For example, in the past, books like 'To Kill a Mockingbird' have been banned for various reasons, yet they offer valuable lessons that",

First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic response to the prompt by discussing how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, focusing on rolling hills, open terrain, and high deserts. However, it lacks depth and specificity in its supporting details, which limits the clarity and persuasiveness of the arguments. The writer uses some real-world examples but does not fully develop them to support their points effectively. The narrative follows a logical sequence, but transitions between ideas are somewhat abrupt, making the flow less smooth. While the language is generally clear and functional, it shows occasional errors in spelling and grammar, such as \"terran,\" \"hgh,\" and \"mles,\" which detract from the overall readability. Improving the essay would involve elaborating on the points with more detailed and specific examples, enhancing the transitions between ideas for better coherence, and carefully proofreading to correct grammatical errors.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay lacks clarity and practical relevance, making it difficult for the reader to follow the main points. The thesis is neither clear nor well-developed, leaving the intent and purpose of the essay ambiguous. The arguments are simplistic and not supported by real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning, which diminishes their impact. The conclusion is ineffective and fails to reinforce the thesis with practical implications. The organizational structure is weak, with ideas that are not coherently presented or logically connected through clear transitions and defined topic sentences. In terms of language and style, the essay employs a limited vocabulary, with word choices that are often inappropriate for the context, and sentence structures that are awkward and disjointed. The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which further impedes readability and detracts from the essay's overall quality. To improve, the essay needs a clear thesis, well-supported arguments with real-world examples, a logical structure with coherent transitions, appropriate and varied vocabulary, and meticulous attention to grammatical conventions.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The arhuror concludes this story with this paragraph to show people that the story or people in the story have a thing for nature or like writing about nature like whats in nature the change or maybe this story is about nature at its best.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is quite disorganized and lacks clarity and practical focus. The thesis is unclear, and the content is not developed with concrete, real-world evidence or pragmatic reasoning. The argument about the story and nature is repetitive and vague, leaving the reader without a clear understanding of the author's point. Additionally, the conclusion does not effectively reinforce the thesis or provide practical implications. Structurally, the essay falls short of the expected standards. It lacks a coherent organization, with no clear introduction, body, or conclusion. Transitions between ideas are absent, making the essay difficult to follow. The language and style used are inappropriate for the audience and purpose; there are numerous grammatical errors, misspellings, and issues with punctuation and capitalization. Words are often misused, which further obscures the intended meaning. Overall, the essay needs significant revision to improve clarity, practicality, structure, and adherence to standard writing conventions.\n\n\n\n---------------------------\n\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Certin features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes he\u0092s experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town. ''at first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little scketle at it because the old \u0093codgers\u0094  told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel.\u0094 Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men.        \nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "The essay begins with a relevant focus on how specific features of the setting affected the cyclist, which is a good start. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance clarity, depth, and cohesion.\n\n1. **Clarity and Practicality**: Your initial sentence is somewhat vague. Consider specifying which features you will discuss. For example, \"Certain features of the desert setting, such as the ghost town and the lack of water, significantly affected the cyclist.\"\n\n2. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis is implied rather than clearly stated. Try to formulate a concise thesis that encapsulates your main points. For instance, \"In Joe Kurmaskie's essay, the harsh desert conditions and ghost towns profoundly challenge the cyclist, both physically and mentally.\"\n\n3. **Supporting Details**: While you reference specific parts of the essay, your supporting details need more development and specificity. Describe how these elements affected the cyclist's journey in more detail. For example, explain how the \"ghost town\" and \"lack of water\" specifically impacted him.\n\n4. **Real-World Examples**: Utilize more real-world examples or practical analogies to strengthen your arguments. Relate Kurmaskie's experiences to more general examples of how harsh environments can affect travelers. This will add depth to your analysis.\n\n5. **Organization and Transitions**: Your transitions between ideas are abrupt, making the essay harder to follow. Use transitional phrases to connect your points logically. For example, \"Initially amused by the ghost town's eerie charm, the cyclist soon finds these same elements to be sources of hardship.\"\n\n6. **Grammar and Word Choice**: There are several grammatical errors and misspellings that distract from the readability of your essay. Pay close attention to spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. For example, \"desribes\" should be \"describes,\" \"difinition\" should be \"definition,\" and \"skeletle\" should be \"skeptical.\" A thorough proofreading can help catch these errors.\n\n7. **Conclusions and Implications**: Your conclusion should reinforce your thesis and provide practical implications. Summarize how the setting's features affected the cyclist and what this might suggest about dealing with similar challenges in real life.\n\nHere is a revised version of your initial passage for reference:\n\n\"Certain features of the desert setting, such as the ghost town and the lack of water, significantly affected the cyclist. In Joe Kurmaskie\u2019s essay, he describes his experiences cycling through a desert: '...arrived at the first town...it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.' Initially amused and perhaps skeptical because the old 'codgers' claimed it was once thriving, the cyclist soon faces the harsh reality: 'sometimes life can be so cruel.' As his water supply dwindles and the park remains distant, he feels overwhelmed by the endless hills of nothingness under the scorching sun. The ghost town and lack of shade or water are crucial features that make the cyclist regret taking",

First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic response to the prompt by discussing how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, focusing on rolling hills, open terrain, and high deserts. However, it lacks depth and specificity in its supporting details, which limits the clarity and persuasiveness of the arguments. The writer uses some real-world examples but does not fully develop them to support their points effectively. The narrative follows a logical sequence, but transitions between ideas are somewhat abrupt, making the flow less smooth. While the language is generally clear and functional, it shows occasional errors in spelling and grammar, such as \"terran,\" \"hgh,\" and \"mles,\" which detract from the overall readability. Improving the essay would involve elaborating on the points with more detailed and specific examples, enhancing the transitions between ideas for better coherence, and carefully proofreading to correct grammatical errors.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay lacks clarity and practical relevance, making it difficult for the reader to follow the main points. The thesis is neither clear nor well-developed, leaving the intent and purpose of the essay ambiguous. The arguments are simplistic and not supported by real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning, which diminishes their impact. The conclusion is ineffective and fails to reinforce the thesis with practical implications. The organizational structure is weak, with ideas that are not coherently presented or logically connected through clear transitions and defined topic sentences. In terms of language and style, the essay employs a limited vocabulary, with word choices that are often inappropriate for the context, and sentence structures that are awkward and disjointed. The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which further impedes readability and detracts from the essay's overall quality. To improve, the essay needs a clear thesis, well-supported arguments with real-world examples, a logical structure with coherent transitions, appropriate and varied vocabulary, and meticulous attention to grammatical conventions.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The arhuror concludes this story with this paragraph to show people that the story or people in the story have a thing for nature or like writing about nature like whats in nature the change or maybe this story is about nature at its best.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is quite disorganized and lacks clarity and practical focus. The thesis is unclear, and the content is not developed with concrete, real-world evidence or pragmatic reasoning. The argument about the story and nature is repetitive and vague, leaving the reader without a clear understanding of the author's point. Additionally, the conclusion does not effectively reinforce the thesis or provide practical implications. Structurally, the essay falls short of the expected standards. It lacks a coherent organization, with no clear introduction, body, or conclusion. Transitions between ideas are absent, making the essay difficult to follow. The language and style used are inappropriate for the audience and purpose; there are numerous grammatical errors, misspellings, and issues with punctuation and capitalization.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay identifies several features that impact the cyclist, such as the sun, ghost towns, obstacles, and terrain, which is a good start. However, there are areas where you can improve to make your writing clearer and more effective.\n\n1. **Clarity and Specificity**: Your ideas are somewhat disorganized, and some sentences are difficult to understand. For example, \"THE THIRSTY-NESS REDUFROM HIM TO USE HIS LIMITED SUPPLY OF WATER\" is confusing. Consider rephrasing this to something clearer, like \"The intense heat made the cyclist thirsty, forcing him to use his limited water supply.\"\n\n2. **Logical Organization**: Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Start with a strong introduction that outlines the main points you will discuss. Each paragraph should focus on a single feature and explain how it affects the cyclist. For example, have one paragraph about the sun, another about ghost towns, and so on.\n\n3. **Practical Language**: Use practical and precise language. Avoid vague phrases and ensure your word choice is appropriate for the context. For instance, instead of \"HE USES MUCH ENERGY TO SUMMER THE HELL,\" you could say, \"He expended a lot of energy to climb the steep hill.\"\n\n4. **Real-World Examples**: While you do mention specific features like \"TUMBLEWEEDS\" and \"PAVEMENT BLOCKING SNAKES,\" try to elaborate on how these obstacles impact the cyclist's journey in real-world terms. What specific challenges do they present?\n\n5. **Grammar and Spelling**: Pay attention to grammar and spelling errors, as they can detract from the readability of your essay. For example, \"REDUFROM\" should be \"reduced,\" and \"RAM-SHACKLE SHEDS\" should be \"ramshackle sheds.\" Proofreading your work can help catch these mistakes.\n\n6. **Transitions and Flow**: Improve the flow of your essay by using smooth transitions between ideas. Instead of abruptly jumping from one point to another, use transitional phrases to guide the reader. For example, \"In addition to the sun's heat, the ghost towns also posed challenges...\"\n\n7. **Conclusion**: End with a strong conclusion that summarizes your main points and reinforces your thesis. This helps to give your essay a sense of completeness and leaves a lasting impression on the reader.\n\nHere\u2019s a revised version of the first part of your paragraph to demonstrate these points:\n\n\"The setting presents various features that significantly impact the cyclist. One major challenge is the intense heat of the sun, which makes the cyclist hot and thirsty, forcing him to use his limited water supply. This not only depletes his resources but also increases his risk of dehydration. Additionally, the run-down ghost towns, with their ramshackle sheds and rusty pumps, contribute to a sense of hopelessness. These towns lack the necessary amenities, leaving the cyclist without a place to refill his water and exacerbating",

The thesis statement is almost non-existent, and there is a lack of coherent development and support for any argument.

        "llmResponse": "FEEDBACK: You've made a good start in trying to break down the author's purpose in concluding the story with that particular paragraph. However, there are several areas where your writing can be improved to better meet the criteria for effective communication.\n\n1. **Clarity and Coherence:** Your explanation is somewhat unclear and could be more coherent. Try to avoid phrases like \"I think to say\" and \"I think that is why\" as they make your argument sound tentative. Instead, be assertive and clear in your statements. For example, you could write: \"The author concludes the story with that paragraph to signify the cyclical nature of the protagonist's journey. The blooming of the hibiscus symbolizes her readiness to face challenges anew.\"\n\n2. **Support with Real-World Examples:** Your argument would be stronger if you supported it with more concrete reasoning. In this case, you have quoted a relevant part of the story, which is good. However, you should explain how this quote supports your interpretation. For example: \"She states, 'In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again,' which suggests that the protagonist sees the blooming hibiscus as a sign of new beginnings and personal growth.\"\n\n3. **Organization and Structure:** Your paragraph needs a bit more structure to improve its flow. Start with a clear thesis statement, then provide evidence, and conclude with how this evidence supports your thesis. Here's a suggested structure:\n   - **Thesis Statement:** The author concludes the story with this paragraph to highlight the protagonist's readiness to start anew with the blooming of the hibiscus.\n   - **Evidence:** The quote \"In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again\" underscores this cyclical renewal.\n   - **Conclusion:** This indicates that the protagonist associates the blooming hibiscus with a fresh start, reinforcing the theme of resilience and new beginnings.\n\n4. **Grammar and Language Use:** Pay attention to grammar and punctuation to ensure your writing is polished and professional. For instance, \"hibiscus\" should be \"hibiscuses\" to match the plural context if referring to multiple blooms, or simply \"the hibiscus\" if singular.\n\nOverall, you are on the right track, but your writing will benefit from clearer structure, stronger support with specific examples, and a focus on grammatical accuracy. Keep working on these aspects to enhance the clarity and impact of your essays. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!",

The thesis statement is almost non-existent, and there is a lack of coherent development and support for any argument. The single sentence provided does not adequately introduce or conclude the topic, nor does it present a clear opinion or argument regarding the effects computers have on people or censorship in libraries. There are no real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning to support the writer\u2019s stance, which significantly weakens the content. Additionally, the sentence structure is awkward, with grammatical errors that hinder readability. The absence of transitional phrases and logical flow makes the essay difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on developing a clear thesis, supporting arguments with concrete examples, and ensuring grammatical accuracy while maintaining a structured and coherent narrative.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is extremely difficult to understand due to its lack of clarity and coherence. The thesis is unclear and not relevant to any prompt, making it challenging for the reader to grasp the main idea or argument. The essay does not develop or support its arguments with real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning. Moreover, the structure of the essay is disorganized, with no clear introduction, body, or conclusion, and transitions between ideas are either nonexistent or very awkward. The language and word choice are inappropriate and inconsistent, and there are numerous grammatical errors, including problems with spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which significantly impede readability. Overall, the essay lacks clarity, practicality, real-world relevance, and linguistic precision, failing to meet the basic criteria of the guidelines provided. Improvements in content development, organization, language, and adherence to the prompt are necessary for a higher evaluation.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay lacks clarity and practical relevance, making it difficult for the reader to follow the main points. The thesis is neither clear nor well-developed, leaving the intent and purpose of the essay ambiguous. The arguments are simplistic and not supported by real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning, which diminishes their impact. The conclusion is ineffective and fails to reinforce the thesis with practical implications. The organizational structure is weak, with ideas that are not coherently presented or logically connected through clear transitions and defined topic sentences. In terms of language and style, the essay employs a limited vocabulary, with word choices that are often inappropriate for the context, and sentence structures that are awkward and disjointed. The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which further impedes readability and detracts from the essay's overall quality. To improve, the essay needs a clear thesis, well-supported arguments with real-world examples, a logical structure with coherent transitions, appropriate and varied vocabulary, and meticulous attention to grammatical conventions.\n\n\n\n---------------------------\n\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is by herself, and letting herself know that she is going to try the test she failed again because she is starting to get used to her new home now that shes found something that reminds her of her life before she left.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "The passage you have written has a meaningful idea but needs improvement for clarity and coherence. Let's break it down to enhance the overall quality:\n\n1. **Clarity and Conciseness**: The sentence is quite long and complex, making it difficult to follow. Simplify your sentences to convey your ideas more clearly.\n   \n   *Example*: \"The author concludes the story with Saeng deciding to retake the test she failed. She feels more comfortable in her new home now that she has found something that reminds her of her past.\"\n\n2. **Thesis and Argument Development**: Your paragraph lacks a clear thesis and does not fully develop the argument. You need to clearly state why Saeng\u2019s realization is significant to the conclusion of the story.\n\n   *Example*: \"The author ends the story with Saeng's decision to retake the test to illustrate her growing sense of belonging in her new home.\"\n\n3. **Use of Real-World Examples**: Integrate real-world relevance to strengthen your argument. Why is it important that Saeng feels at home, and how does this relate to broader themes or lessons?\n\n   *Example*: \"Just as people find comfort in familiar surroundings when adjusting to new environments, Saeng\u2019s connection to her past helps her build confidence in her new life.\"\n\n4. **Grammar and Style**: There are minor grammatical issues, such as the lack of an apostrophe in \"shes\" which should be \"she's.\" Additionally, aim for varied word choice to keep your writing engaging.\n\n   *Example*: \"She\u2019s found something that reminds her of her previous life, giving her the courage to face challenges anew.\"\n\n5. **Logical Flow and Transitions**: Ensure your ideas flow logically from one to the next with smooth transitions. This will make your writing easier to read and understand.\n\n   *Example*: \"Having found a reminder of her past, Saeng feels more at ease in her new surroundings, which gives her the determination to retake the test she previously failed.\"\n\nBy focusing on these areas, you can transform your writing to be more clear, concise, and impactful. Don't hesitate to ask for further clarification on any of these points. Keep practicing, and you'll continue to improve!",

The thesis statement is not clearly articulated, and the arguments are not well-developed or supported by specific examples. The structure is somewhat disjointed, with an abrupt transition from the mood discussion to the summary of Narciso Rodriguez's story. The essay's language and style contain several grammatical errors and misspellings, such as \"diffucult,\" \"depresing,\" and \"gratefull.\" Sentence structures are often awkward and lack variety.

        "llmResponse": "The essay demonstrates a heartfelt connection to the themes of home and family, and you have captured the mood of appreciation effectively. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to align with our class's writing goals.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement:** Your essay would benefit greatly from a clearer thesis statement that explicitly states the main point you will be discussing. This will provide a solid foundation for your arguments and make your essay more cohesive.\n\n2. **Development of Arguments:** While you touch on key elements like the author\u2019s appreciation for his parents and the sense of family, these points need further development with specific, real-world examples. For instance, you could elaborate on particular moments from the memoir that illustrate these feelings more vividly.\n\n3. **Quotations and Analysis:** You've included relevant quotes, which is excellent. However, ensure that these quotes are integrated smoothly into your text and accompanied by detailed analysis. Explain how each quote supports your overall argument and the mood you\u2019re trying to convey.\n\n4. **Organization and Transitions:** Your essay would be easier to follow with well-defined topic sentences and smoother transitions between points. For example, clearly separate your discussion of the mood from your analysis of specific aspects of the author\u2019s life and heritage.\n\n5. **Language and Grammar:** Pay attention to spelling and grammatical errors such as \"comftable\" (comfortable), \"enviroment\" (environment), \"familly\" (family), and \"wiched\" (which). Also, be mindful of sentence structure and punctuation to ensure clarity and readability.\n\n6. **Concluding Thoughts:** Your conclusion should reinforce your thesis and main points, tying everything together in a coherent summary. The current conclusion is a good start but can be more impactful if you succinctly restate how the author\u2019s appreciation for his family and heritage is conveyed through the memoir.\n\n**Specific Suggestions:**\n- Revise your thesis to be more explicit about the main argument.\n- Expand on examples and provide detailed explanations on how they support your thesis.\n- Improve transitions between paragraphs to maintain a logical flow.\n- Proofread your work for spelling and grammatical accuracy.\n\nOverall, your essay has a strong emotional foundation. By focusing on clarity, structure, and detailed support, you can enhance the effectiveness of your writing. Keep up the good work and continue to refine your skills!",

        "textSelection": "Most modern day book, movies, music, etc. do a fairly good job of placing warning in the form of '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticks on their covers. But books from before this practice began to happen @MONTH1 be found more offensive then books today. Why? Well, that's because many books of the past use words that today are found offensive. But those books, movies, and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem. There are examples of how each catagory is in today's society.     Take the book 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', written by @PERSON1, for example. In that story, there are words that are used to describe people of that time.. Back when @PERSON1 wrote the book, it was perfectly fine to use those words on those people, but in today's modern world, that is a book that has been on the list for being banned. It is offensive to use that word on people today, so parent groups and others are trying to get that book pulled off of shelves in hopes of erasing what was done in the past. I don't believe that a book should be banned for it's content, but rather how well it teaches its reader through its words. If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and the culture of that time, then it shouldn't be banned at all. It should be read.     Movies have a rating system for a reason. There are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience. People must be of a certain age to rent, buy, or view these kind of movies 'leagally'. Not too many people listen to that system, even though it has exsisted for years. A horror film is not suitable for a @CAPS15 of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on @CAPS4. Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a @CAPS15 nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong. That is the fault of the parents. They were the ones who let their @CAPS15 watch that movie in the first place. So the movie shouldn't be held responsible for the @CAPS15. If the movie was intended for a more mature audience, that's the way it should stay.     And that brings us to music. There is a lot of music in today's age that can be considered very offensive. There are only a few 'pure' genres, free of the cursing that is used in many of the others today. But children, teen, and adults all find their favorite kind, and you can't change their minds then. The governement has issued that all music containing harsh words, horrid images to the mind, gruesome scenes, and other elements that are offensive to people, must carry a sticker on it. The black and white '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticker. When parents see this sticker on the @CAPS7, @NUM1 download, or whatever their @CAPS15 is using, then they know that it is more than likely not right for their @CAPS15 to listen to. Doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it means that there is a slight chance that their minds will not be tainted by 'garbage'.     So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't neccessarily mean that it is the same to another person. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society. People will still argue that books such as 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON2', '@CAPS10 in the @CAPS11', and many, many more books like them should be banned. They will always fight that movies such as 'A @CAPS12 on @CAPS13 @CAPS14,' '@DATE1 the @NUM2', or '@CAPS15's @CAPS16' should be removed from store shelves because it gave them nightmares as a @CAPS19 or it gives their @CAPS15 nightmares because they saw it. And they will always try to fight and say that artist like @CAPS17' @CAPS18, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS19 @CAPS20 are not suited for their @CAPS15. Well, this pattern has been going on for years. Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for a adult audience, not for a @CAPS15 of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue about what should be on shelves and what should not, remember that it might be that parent's fault for letting their @CAPS15 view it in the first place.",

Overall, the essay demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and reflects a genuine personal voice, aligning well with the teacher's emphasis on originality and creative expression.\n\n\n\n---------------------------\n\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Most modern day book, movies, music, etc. do a fairly good job of placing warning in the form of '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticks on their covers. But books from before this practice began to happen @MONTH1 be found more offensive then books today. Why? Well, that's because many books of the past use words that today are found offensive. But those books, movies, and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem. There are examples of how each catagory is in today's society.     Take the book 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', written by @PERSON1, for example. In that story, there are words that are used to describe people of that time.. Back when @PERSON1 wrote the book, it was perfectly fine to use those words on those people, but in today's modern world, that is a book that has been on the list for being banned. It is offensive to use that word on people today, so parent groups and others are trying to get that book pulled off of shelves in hopes of erasing what was done in the past. I don't believe that a book should be banned for it's content, but rather how well it teaches its reader through its words. If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and the culture of that time, then it shouldn't be banned at all. It should be read.     Movies have a rating system for a reason. There are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience. People must be of a certain age to rent, buy, or view these kind of movies 'leagally'. Not too many people listen to that system, even though it has exsisted for years. A horror film is not suitable for a @CAPS15 of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on @CAPS4. Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a @CAPS15 nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong. That is the fault of the parents. They were the ones who let their @CAPS15 watch that movie in the first place. So the movie shouldn't be held responsible for the @CAPS15. If the movie was intended for a more mature audience, that's the way it should stay.     And that brings us to music. There is a lot of music in today's age that can be considered very offensive. There are only a few 'pure' genres, free of the cursing that is used in many of the others today. But children, teen, and adults all find their favorite kind, and you can't change their minds then. The governement has issued that all music containing harsh words, horrid images to the mind, gruesome scenes, and other elements that are offensive to people, must carry a sticker on it. The black and white '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticker. When parents see this sticker on the @CAPS7, @NUM1 download, or whatever their @CAPS15 is using, then they know that it is more than likely not right for their @CAPS15 to listen to. Doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it means that there is a slight chance that their minds will not be tainted by 'garbage'.     So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't neccessarily mean that it is the same to another person. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society. People will still argue that books such as 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON2', '@CAPS10 in the @CAPS11', and many, many more books like them should be banned. They will always fight that movies such as 'A @CAPS12 on @CAPS13 @CAPS14,' '@DATE1 the @NUM2', or '@CAPS15's @CAPS16' should be removed from store shelves because it gave them nightmares as a @CAPS19 or it gives their @CAPS15 nightmares because they saw it. And they will always try to fight and say that artist like @CAPS17' @CAPS18, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS19 @CAPS20 are not suited for their @CAPS15. Well, this pattern has been going on for years. Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for a adult audience, not for a @CAPS15 of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue about what should be on shelves and what should not, remember that it might be that parent's fault for letting their @CAPS15 view it in the first place.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",

Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to discuss the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the story. The ideas are underdeveloped and the content is minimal, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the intended message. There is a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points being made, which weakens the overall argument. The response also tends to wander off-topic and does not adhere closely to the prompt. The language used is simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors, such as \"shes\" instead of \"she's\" and \"sentance\" instead of \"sentence.\" These errors distract from the readability of the essay and hinder its effectiveness. Additionally, the essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes the narrative difficult to follow.

You have economic loss from the electric bill, health loss because you won't be able to exercise as much, and community less because you won't spen as much with your community. Financial loss is something that many people are concerned\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and focused argument against excessive computer use, supported by recognizable main ideas: financial loss, health issues, and community disintegration. The originality of the thesis could be improved by providing a more unique or thought-provoking perspective on the topic. The essay is satisfactorily organized, with a basic introduction, body, and conclusion, though the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow of ideas. The word choice effectively conveys the intended message, but there is room for more varied and imaginative language to make the essay more engaging. The sentences generally flow well, though some constructions could be more fluid and varied to maintain the reader\u2019s interest. The essay demonstrates control of standard writing conventions, but there are noticeable errors in spelling and grammar that slightly impede readability. Overall, the essay is clear and persuasive but could benefit from more creative expression and polished language use to fully align with the teacher's emphasis on originality and creative expression.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: loss there is also a health issue.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay, \"Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,\" does a commendable job of identifying key elements in the setting that impact the cyclist, and you've made some insightful observations about how these features contribute to his overall experience. Let's delve deeper into how you can enhance your creative voice and develop your analysis further.\n\nFirstly, your recognition of the hills and the sun as challenging aspects for the cyclist is spot on. However, try to expand on this by adding more descriptive language that immerses the reader in the scene. How might the hills have physically and mentally exhausted the cyclist? Could you describe the heat in a more vivid way to help us feel his discomfort?\n\nYour interpretation of the road sign and its effect on the cyclist introduces a layer of irony that is quite engaging. However, your quotation integration could be smoother. Instead of quoting the speed limit numbers as placeholders, try to weave the quotes seamlessly into your narrative. For example, \"The road sign's stark command, 'Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,' must have felt like a cruel mockery as the cyclist struggled to maintain even a fraction of the speed limit in the oppressive heat.\"\n\nThe mention of the grape juice sign as a source of ironic cruelty is a unique and original observation. To strengthen this point, consider exploring why the cyclist might have felt this way. Was he particularly thirsty, or did the sign remind him of something unattainable in his current state? Adding these layers can make your analysis richer and more thought-provoking.\n\nYour conclusion about the bait shop offering relief is well presented. You effectively show the contrast between the negative and positive aspects of the setting. To enhance this section, delve deeper into the cyclist's emotions upon seeing the bait shop. How did his mood shift? Can you use more evocative language to describe his \"overwhelming urge\" and the sense of relief it brought?\n\nOverall, your essay has a strong foundation, and with a few adjustments, it can shine even brighter. Focus on enriching your descriptions and providing deeper insights into the cyclist's experience. This will not only engage your readers more effectively but also showcase your creative potential and originality. Keep pushing the boundaries of your expression, and don't hesitate to take risks with your writing. You're on a great path!\n\nKeep up the great work, and I look forward to seeing how your unique voice continues to develop.\n\nBest,\n[Teacher's Name]",

        "llmResponse": "Your essay provides a solid starting point in discussing the challenges a cyclist might face on their journey. I appreciate how you identify specific obstacles, such as snakes, rough terrain, and rocks, which adds a layer of realism and detail to your writing. This helps the reader visualize the difficulties a cyclist might encounter, which is a great step toward engaging your audience.\n\nHowever, there are several areas where you can enhance your essay to make it even more compelling and coherent:\n\n1. **Organization and Flow**: Your ideas are currently presented in a somewhat disjointed manner. Try to organize your thoughts into clearer, more distinct paragraphs. For instance, you could have one paragraph discussing the physical challenges (like rocks and rough terrain) and another focusing on the importance of situational awareness and independence for cyclists. This will help your essay flow more smoothly and make it easier for readers to follow your argument.\n\n2. **Specificity and Detail**: You've mentioned some potential hazards, but it would be even more engaging if you included more vivid descriptions or examples. For instance, you could describe a specific scenario where a cyclist navigates a rocky path or encounters a snake, and how they handle those situations. This would not only make your essay more interesting but also provide a clearer picture of the cyclist's experience.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Language**: Varying your sentence structure can make your writing more dynamic. Currently, some sentences are quite short and choppy. Try combining some of your ideas into complex sentences to improve the flow. Additionally, watch out for repetitive phrases and minor grammatical errors. For example, \"That's why it's important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves\" could be revised for clarity and correctness: \"That's why it's crucial for cyclists to rely on their own judgment.\"\n\n4. **Creativity and Originality**: Your essay would benefit from a bit more of your unique voice and creativity. Consider adding a personal anecdote or a hypothetical story to illustrate your points. This can make your essay stand out and resonate more with your readers.\n\n5. **Proofreading**: There are a few grammatical issues that need attention, such as \"theres\" instead of \"there's\" and missing punctuation marks. Careful proofreading can help minimize these errors and ensure your writing is polished and professional.\n\nOverall, you've made a good effort in highlighting the importance of awareness and preparation for cyclists. With some refinement in organization, detail, and language, your essay can become even more impactful and enjoyable to read.

And people dont feel like going to school because their over and there tired and ther just want to use the computer all day with not stopping. And so i think that people are just to addicted to compulers they dont use it for the fright reasons. Had then people get sick they could get hoadaks or they feel like puking. And they dont get to see that of things like go to the @CAPS1, @CAPS2 football,\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates an attempt to discuss the impact of computer usage on individuals, but it lacks clarity and effective organization. The main ideas are present but not fully developed or supported with specific details, making the overall argument somewhat simplistic and broad. The essay's structure is disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a need for a clearer flow of ideas. The language used is repetitive and often inappropriate, with many words misused or misspelled, which detracts significantly from the intended message. Sentence structures are awkward and lack fluidity, causing the reader to frequently pause and reread for comprehension. Additionally, the essay contains numerous grammatical errors, incorrect punctuation, and inconsistent capitalization, which further impede readability. However, there are moments of creative expression, and the writer's point of view is clearly stated, though it requires more refinement and stronger support to be more persuasive and engaging. Improving these areas with a focus on originality and imaginative language use, while maintaining grammatical accuracy, will enhance the overall quality of the essay.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to discuss the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the story. The ideas are underdeveloped and the content is minimal, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the intended message. There is a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points being made, which weakens the overall argument. The response also tends to wander off-topic and does not adhere closely to the prompt. The language used is simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors, such as \"shes\" instead of \"she's\" and \"sentance\" instead of \"sentence.\" These errors distract from the readability of the essay and hinder its effectiveness. Additionally, the essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes the narrative difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing detailed support from the story, maintaining clarity in addressing the prompt, enhancing vocabulary, and ensuring a smooth flow of ideas with proper transitions.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: loss there is also a health issue. Many people are talking about how americans are becoming obise. Part @MONEY1 this is due to spending too much time on the computer. Proffesor @CAPS3 @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 says that, \"the obisety in @LOCATION1 is a problem, if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, that problem would be solved.\" @CAPS4, @NUM5 out @MONEY1 @NUM6 people are obese. If everyone spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, it would become @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM6.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and focused argument against excessive computer use, supported by recognizable main ideas: financial loss, health issues, and community disintegration. The originality of the thesis could be improved by providing a more unique or thought-provoking perspective on the topic. The essay is satisfactorily organized, with a basic introduction, body, and conclusion, though the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow of ideas. The word choice effectively conveys the intended message, but there is room for more varied and imaginative language to make the essay more engaging. The sentences generally flow well, though some constructions could be more fluid and varied to maintain the reader\u2019s interest. The essay demonstrates control of standard writing conventions, but there are noticeable errors in spelling and grammar that slightly impede readability. Overall, the essay is clear and persuasive but could benefit from more creative expression and polished language use to fully align with the teacher's emphasis on originality and creative expression.\n\n\n\n---------------------------\n\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isn\u0092t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "The passage you\u2019ve written explores the influence of settings on cyclists\u2019 experiences, which is a compelling topic! Here are some insightful points that can help elevate your essay:\n\n1. **Creative Introduction and Expression:** You\u2019ve chosen a great topic that allows for vivid descriptions and emotional depth. Try starting with a captivating scene to draw readers in. For instance, \"Imagine cycling through a picturesque valley where every turn reveals a new vista, the pain in your muscles momentarily forgotten...\"\n\n2. **Developing Ideas with Depth:** Your idea that a beautiful setting can distract from pain is intriguing. To deepen this point, include specific examples or anecdotes. Perhaps describe a scenario where a cyclist overcomes a grueling ride by focusing on a breathtaking landscape.\n\n3. **Language and Word Choice:** While your message is clear, it can be enriched with more varied and imaginative language. Instead of saying \"nice\" or \"not very nice,\" use more descriptive words like \"serene,\" \"picturesque,\" \"bleak,\" or \"monotonous.\" This will make your writing more engaging.\n\n4. **Organizational Flow:** Your essay would benefit from clearer transitions and structured paragraphs. For each point you make, start a new paragraph. For example, the impact of a \"nice\" setting can be one paragraph, and the influence of a \"not nice\" setting can be another.\n\n5. **Fluid Sentence Structures:** Some sentences can be restructured for better fluidity. For example, instead of \"also, if the setting isn\u2019t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery,\" you could write, \"Conversely, in an uninspiring environment, cyclists might find their focus shifting more towards their physical discomfort.\"\n\n6. **Attention to Detail and Proofreading:** There are minor grammatical errors and repetitions, such as \u201cthe cyclist could could get dehydrated faster.\u201d Careful proofreading will help catch these mistakes. Reading your essay aloud can also help you catch any awkward phrasing or repetitive words.\n\n7. **Encouraging Originality and Voice:** Your essay touches on an interesting perspective about the mental and physical aspects of cycling. Push yourself to delve deeper into this perspective\u2014how does the setting influence not just the body but also the spirit of the cyclist? \n\nOverall, you\u2019re on the right track with your ideas. By enhancing the descriptive language, organizing your thoughts clearly, and paying attention to detail, you\u2019ll create a more compelling and polished piece. Keep nurturing your creative voice and exploring these unique perspectives. Wonderful effort!",

He is a caring young boy.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a genuine effort to explore the theme of family gratitude in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, but it lacks the originality and creative expression that could elevate it. While it includes specific quotations from the memoir, the analysis remains superficial and doesn't delve deeply into the unique aspects of Rodriguez's experiences or emotions. The introduction could be more engaging, and the body paragraphs would benefit from smoother transitions and more innovative development of arguments.

While it mentions his Cuban nationality and pride, as well as his residence in Newark and family dynamics, it lacks specificity and depth in its supporting arguments. The response does not effectively utilize evidence from the memoir to strengthen its points, leading to a surface-level engagement with the topic. In terms of language, the essay demonstrates adequate grammar and spelling, with some minor errors and a limited range of vocabulary. The structure is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of cohesive flow between ideas, making it challenging to follow the narrative smoothly.
