0,2,"The essay presents several challenges that impede its effectiveness in arguing the benefits of computers. The thesis is not clearly stated, leading to confusion about the central argument. The lack of substantial evidence and logical reasoning to support the claims made further weakens the content. Additionally, the essay's organization is lacking, with a disjointed structure and abrupt transitions that make it difficult to follow the flow of ideas. The language and style are problematic, with inappropriate technical terminology and awkward sentence constructions. Common grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling and punctuation, further detract from readability. To improve, the essay should focus on articulating a clear thesis, supporting arguments with concrete data and logical reasoning, organizing ideas coherently, using precise vocabulary, and adhering to standard writing conventions.",2,"Dear [Student],

Thank you for sharing your essay on the importance of computers in modern society. Your effort to explore the topic is commendable, and I appreciate your willingness to engage with such a relevant issue. Here are some specific points of feedback that should help you refine and strengthen your essay further:

**Content:**
- *Thesis Clarity*: The main argument of your essay—that computers are essential in today's society—needs to be articulated more precisely in your thesis statement. Providing a clear and strong thesis will give your essay a solid foundation.
- *Evidence and Reasoning*: While you mention various ways computers are useful, such as looking up information and chatting with friends, these points would be more compelling with concrete evidence or data to support them. For example, including statistics or studies that document the benefits of computers would strengthen your arguments.

**Organization:**
- *Logical Structure*: Your essay would benefit from a more organized structure. Starting with a clear introduction that presents your thesis, followed by well-defined body paragraphs with distinct topic sentences, and concluding with a synthesizing conclusion would enhance readability and coherence.
- *Transitions*: Ensure smooth transitions between your points to help the reader follow your argument more easily. For instance, when moving from chatting with friends to the importance of the local internet, use transitional phrases to ensure the ideas are connected logically.

**Language and Style:**
- *Precision and Clarity*: You have moments where your language is clear, but there are instances where precision is lacking. For example, the sentence ""Research shows over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 says computer is everything"" could be refined to be more specific and accurate. Make sure to replace placeholders like ""@PERCENT1"" with actual data and ensure all sentences are clear and precise.
- *Vocabulary*: Be mindful of word choice to convey your ideas more effectively. Phrases like ""not trying to be mean"" could be replaced with more formal expressions to maintain an academic tone.

**Conventions:**
- *Grammar and Punctuation*: The essay contains several grammatical errors and punctuation issues. For instance, ""dident"" should be ""didn't,"" and ""Reseach"" should be ""Research."" Carefully proofread your work to correct these mistakes.
- *Capitalization*: Ensure proper use of capitalization throughout your essay. Terms like ""opinion"" and ""percent"" should not be capitalized unless they begin a sentence.

**Overall Feedback:**
Your essay presents an interesting perspective on the importance of computers, but it requires more precise articulation and stronger evidential support. A clearer thesis, better organization, improved clarity, and grammatical accuracy will significantly enhance your writing. Keep up the hard work, and continue to refine your skills; your dedication to improving your writing is evident and much appreciated.

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 people use computers but not every one agress that it benefits society. In my opinion, computers benefit society. There are @CAPS1 websites that can help you find information. Computers also allow people to work easily. A third reason is @CAPS1 companies are able to use them to gain business. If you are doing a project or need to look up information about something, the internet is one of the easiest ways to find that information. Google.com has so much information

TEACHER FEEDBACK: This essay presents a clear stance on the benefits of computers to society and supports the thesis with relevant examples and logical reasoning. However, the thesis could be more precise to provide a stronger foundation for the argument. The essay is well-organized, with clear transitions between points, although the topic sentences could be more defined to enhance readability. The use of language is mostly effective, but there are moments where vocabulary could be more varied and precise to convey the intended message more powerfully. Sentence structures are generally clear and varied, contributing to a smooth flow of ideas. On the other hand, the essay has several minor grammatical errors and some issues with capitalization, which slightly impede the overall readability. Strengthening the thesis statement, refining topic sentences, and correcting grammatical errors would further enhance the clarity, structure, and content of this essay.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 these days are telling kids to go outside instead of vegging out in front of a computer. Computers can but promote bad habits. I try not to use the computer unless I have too for school or to get homework. Please consider the negative effects which are exercising in apropprate content and less interaction with friends/family. Yes internets can be used to find diets and exercise plans but if you would just go to the gym to burn of those pounds everything would be just fine!

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the negative effects of computer usage, primarily focusing on issues such as lack of exercise, exposure to inappropriate content, and reduced social interactions. However, the thesis statement lacks precision and clarity, and the arguments, though supported by personal anecdotes, are not substantiated with substantial evidence or data. The logical progression of ideas is somewhat present but fragmented, impacting the overall coherence. The structure of the essay could benefit from better-defined topic sentences and smoother transitions between paragraphs. The vocabulary used is appropriate, though there are areas where word choice could be more precise to enhance the overall message. Sentence structures are varied but occasionally awkward, which disrupts the flow of the essay. Grammatical errors, incorrect spelling, and punctuation issues are present but do not severely impede readability. Overall, while the essay conveys a personal perspective on the topic, it would benefit from stronger organization, clearer thesis articulation, and more robust evidence-based support to effectively persuade the reader.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======

Using computers helps society. you can easily find what you are looking for and you are able talk to anyone you want. Also, it is easy for companies to attract business. Those are only a few of the @CAPS1 reasons why computers are good for society.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: This essay presents a clear stance on the benefits of computers to society and supports the thesis with relevant examples and logical reasoning. However, the thesis could be more precise to provide a stronger foundation for the argument. The essay is well-organized, with clear transitions between points, although the topic sentences could be more defined to enhance readability.

TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Dear Student,

Thank you for your effort on this essay. I appreciate your enthusiasm and the points you make about the importance of computers and the internet. Here are some areas where you can improve your writing:

1. **Organization and Clarity**: Your essay needs a clear structure with an introduction, body, and conclusion. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea or point to enhance coherence.

   - **Introduction**: Start with an introductory sentence that presents the main idea of your essay. This will help set the stage for your argument.
   - **Body**: Develop each of your points in separate paragraphs, providing evidence and examples.
   - **Conclusion**: Summarize your main points and restate the importance of your argument.

2. **Grammar and Sentence Structure**: Pay attention to grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure to ensure your essay is easy to read and understand.

   - Avoid run-on sentences and sentence fragments.
   - Ensure subject-verb agreement, such as ""internet these days is very good for people"" instead of ""internet these days are very good for people.""
   - Clarify ambiguous sentences, such as ""For little world neve should get to bed at least @NUM1 pm.""

3. **Spelling and Word Choice**: Correct spelling errors and choose words that convey your ideas more precisely.

   - ""dident"" should be ""didn't.""
   - ""Reseach"" should be ""Research.""
   - ""oppinion"" should be ""opinion.""

4. **Use of Placeholders**: Replace placeholders like @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, @PERCENT1, @CAPS2, and @NUM1 with specific information. This will make your essay more concrete and less generic.

5. **Tone and Formality**: Maintain a formal tone appropriate for an academic essay.

   - Avoid conversational phrases or comments that can be perceived as informal or unclear, such as ""not trying to be mean.""

Here is a revised version of your introduction and conclusion as an example to guide you:

**Original Introduction and Conclusion**:
> Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 idea about ""Computers"" is very well thought outside of the box. Well. We sure need computer to look up information these days.

**Revised Introduction and Conclusion**:
>",0.8990091658246857,0.8924990523534803
1,6,"The essay presents a clear stance on the issue of censoring offensive materials in libraries, but it could benefit significantly from a more structured and logical progression of ideas. The thesis is somewhat vague, and the arguments, while present, lack substantial evidence and specific examples that could strengthen the overall argument. There are instances where the writing becomes repetitive and digresses from the main point, affecting the overall coherence. The use of vocabulary is appropriate and varied, which helps in conveying the message more effectively. Sentence structures are mostly clear and varied, contributing to the readability of the essay. However, there are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that could be refined. To improve, the essay should focus on clearly defining the thesis, using concrete evidence to support arguments, and maintaining a logical flow throughout. Additionally, polishing the language and ensuring grammatical accuracy will enhance the essay's overall quality.",6,"The essay on the appropriateness of library materials presents a strong opinion on the matter, advocating for a selective approach to what should be available to young readers. Your argument—that certain offensive materials should be restricted to adults—addresses an important concern but would benefit from more detailed and specific support.

**Content:**
Your thesis is clear, but it needs to be more precise. Instead of broadly stating that ""offensive materials"" should be restricted, specify what you mean by ""offensive"" and why these materials pose a particular threat. Additionally, while you mention books and movies as problematic due to violence and inappropriate behavior, more concrete examples would strengthen your argument.

**Organization:**
The essay lacks a cohesive structure, making it difficult to follow your line of reasoning. Your points are somewhat repetitive and could be better organized into distinct paragraphs with clear topic sentences. For instance, one paragraph could focus on the potential harm of violent content, another on inappropriate behavior, and another on proposed solutions like restricted access for adults only.

**Language and Style:**
Your language is somewhat simplistic and could be more precise. Avoid using conversational phrases like ""these days"" or rhetorical questions such as ""What do you think?"" These weaken the academic tone of your essay. Instead, use formal language and support your claims with evidence and logical reasoning.

**Conventions:**
There are several grammatical errors and awkward sentences that disrupt the flow of your essay. For example, ""against some peoples religion"" should be ""against some people's religion,"" and ""based of a book series"" should be ""based on a book series."" Additionally, ensure you use the correct form of modal verbs like ""may"" or ""might"" instead of ""@MONTH1."" Meticulous proofreading is essential to correct these errors and enhance readability.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **Clarify Your Thesis:** Specify what constitutes ""offensive materials"" and why they should be restricted.
2. **Provide Specific Examples:** Use concrete examples of books, movies, or shows that illustrate your points about violence and inappropriate behavior.
3. **Enhance Organization:** Create clear, distinct paragraphs with well-defined topic sentences and logical transitions between ideas.
4. **Refine Language and Style:** Use more formal, precise language and avoid conversational phrases.
5. **Proofread Thoroughly:** Address grammatical errors, awkward sentences, and punctuation issues to improve the overall quality of your writing.

Your essay addresses an important issue with clear passion and concern. By focusing on these areas for improvement, you can strengthen your argument and present a more compelling case. Keep up the hard work, and continue refining your writing skills!","

Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. I believe that even if books, music, movies or magazines on the bookshelves are offense, they should still be left there. They are apart of our history and the history we're creating.     If anyone wants to read a certain book or magazine, there's a big chance they will end up reading it. There are so many ways to get to those things with the technology we have today. You could just look them up online and read them or listen to them off the

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance against the practice, advocating for the preservation of all materials regardless of their potential to offend. The central argument—that censorship is futile given technological access and potentially harmful to community dynamics—is reasonably well-articulated, though it could benefit from more specific and detailed support. The essay lacks a cohesive structure, with ideas presented in a somewhat disjointed manner. Clearer transitions and a more organized flow of arguments would enhance readability and effectiveness. The vocabulary used is appropriate and conveys the intended message, though there are some areas where more precise language could strengthen the argument. Sentence structures are varied but occasionally awkward, disrupting the overall fluidity of the text. While the essay demonstrates a good command of basic writing conventions, a few grammatical errors and inconsistencies (such as ""i've"" instead of ""I've"") need attention. Overall, the essay makes a strong case but would benefit from a more polished and systematically organized presentation.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: that could be debated about being censored.     A lot of books and movies, great ones even, contain some offensive content but they are classics. Generations, one after the other, have enjoyed them.     Now tell me, who would want to be the unreasonable person and take that away from anyone who is interested? Everyone should have the right to these books, magazines, movies, and music. Libraries should not censor them.

I would like more organization for certian things, I do know people have their own ideas about things that should be in a book. These books found in a library could bring enjoyment to people,

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear stance on the need for a more organized system in libraries to help users avoid content they may find offensive. However, the thesis lacks precision and could benefit from a more focused statement of purpose. The arguments presented are somewhat repetitive and underdeveloped, lacking substantial evidence or logical reasoning to support the proposed solution. The essay is disorganized, with ideas not flowing logically from one to the next. Transitions between paragraphs are weak, making it difficult to follow the argument. The language used is simplistic and contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors, which detract from the essay's overall effectiveness. Additionally, the sentence structures are often awkward and unclear, further impeding readability. To improve, the essay needs a clearer thesis, better-developed arguments supported by concrete evidence, a more logical organization, varied and precise word choice, and meticulous proofreading to correct language conventions.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: In my opinion, I do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves. These materials @MONTH1 not be offensive to some people, but it can be to others. They can be against some peoples religion and way of life.     I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf. Now they are putting those same books in libraries. These books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them. Are these books you want your children to be reading?      There are even movies that are like those books. Many shows are based of a book series, and that series @MONTH1 not be a good one. The series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers. The kids could see something they think is really neat on the @CAPS1 and then go out and try that. They do not understand that what they do @MONTH1 not be a good thing. They could get into a lot more trouble then they want to get in.     I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all. In my opinion, the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them. After that, the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them.     There are some that would agree with my opinion and some that would not. What do you think? Do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way? Would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good? Or do you want them to know what they should and should not do?
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay. You have tackled an important and relevant topic, and your passion for the subject is evident. Here are some suggestions to help you improve your essay:

1. **Clarity and Precision**:
   - Your arguments would be stronger if you provided specific examples of the ""overly offensive materials"" you mention. This would help readers understand exactly what types of content you're referring to.

2. **Consistency**:
   - Make sure your verb tenses are consistent. For example, in the first paragraph, ""These materials @MONTH1 not be offensive"" should be ""These materials may not be offensive."" Also, in the third paragraph, ""the series @MONTH1 not be a good one"" should be ""the series may not be a good one.""

3. **Grammar and Punctuation**:
   - Be careful with grammar and punctuation. For example, ""some peoples religion"" should be ""some people's religion,"" and ""more trouble then they want to get in"" should be ""more trouble than they want to get in.""

4. **Conciseness**:
   - Try to avoid repetition. For example, the repeated phrase ""these books"" can make your sentences feel redundant. Instead, use synonyms or rephrase sentences to maintain the reader's interest.

5. **Structure**:
   - Your essay could benefit from a clearer structure. Consider using an introduction to present your main argument, body paragraphs to explore your points in detail, and a conclusion to summarize your thoughts and restate your position.

6. **Balanced Viewpoint**:
   - While it's clear you feel strongly about this issue, acknowledging counterarguments and addressing them can make your essay more balanced and persuasive. This shows that you have considered different perspectives before forming your opinion.

7. **Engagement**:
   - Posing questions to the reader can be an effective way to engage them, but try to limit the number of rhetorical questions to avoid overwhelming the reader. Instead, focus on making compelling arguments that naturally lead the reader to consider your viewpoint.

Here is a revised excerpt from your essay to illustrate some of these suggestions:

---

In my opinion, we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves. While some people might not find these materials offensive, others could be deeply affected, particularly if the content clashes with their religion or way of life. I've encountered books outside of my school library that I believe should be excluded from public libraries due to their violent and inappropriate content. These are not the kinds of books I would want children to read.

Similarly, many movies and TV shows are based on book series that may not be suitable for young audiences. These series often depict violence that can influence children and teenagers. Young viewers might imitate dangerous behaviors they see on screen without understanding the potential consequences.

While some materials labeled as offensive may not be harmful, I believe the most egregious ones should be restricted to adults. This way, parents can decide what is appropriate for their children.",0.9275658798438787,0.9000503683788283
2,10,"The essay suffers from serious deficiencies in clarity, structure, and content, making it difficult to follow and understand. The response does not answer the prompt, failing to address how the features of the setting affect the cyclist and lacking any supporting evidence from the provided text. The sentences are simple and lack complexity and technical precision, with frequent grammatical errors and limited vocabulary. The narrative is disjointed, with no logical progression or cohesive flow of ideas, making it unengaging and ineffective in delivering the intended message. Overall, the essay does not meet the criteria for well-developed content, logical organization, or proficient language use.",10,"The setting affected the cyclist, because he didn’t know if he was going to die or live. He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry.

---

**Teacher Feedback:**

You’ve done a commendable job in identifying the main impact of the setting on the cyclist. However, to develop a more compelling and robust argument, this passage requires additional detail and evidence from the text.

**Content**: Your thesis is on the right track but needs more depth. Instead of simply stating the cyclist’s uncertainty about survival, delve into how the setting's harsh conditions contributed to his fear and desperation. Provide specific examples and quotations from the text to support your claims, such as any particular descriptions of the heat or the cyclist's physical and emotional reactions.

**Organization**: The passage is quite brief, making it challenging to identify a clear structure. To improve, consider breaking it down into multiple sentences that clearly outline the cause-and-effect relationship between the setting and the cyclist's predicament. Start with the setting, explain its effects on the cyclist, and conclude with how these effects influenced his psychological state.

**Language and Style**: Your language is straightforward, which is a good starting point. However, aim to use more precise and varied vocabulary to convey the severity of the situation. Instead of saying ""it was so hot,"" you could describe the heat as ""oppressive"" or ""scorching."" Additionally, ""he didn’t know if he was going to die or live"" could be rephrased to capture the cyclist's panic more vividly.

**Conventions**: Pay attention to grammatical details. For example, the phrase ""because it was so hot and his mouth was dry"" could be more effectively structured. Consider rephrasing to ""due to the oppressive heat, which left his mouth parched."" This not only corrects the structure but also adds precision to your description.

**Summary**: To enhance your essay, focus on providing substantial evidence, developing a clear and logical structure, and refining your language for precision and impact. Incorporate detailed examples and ensure grammatical accuracy to make your argument more compelling. Keep up the effort, and continue to refine these skills!

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The cyclist ran into many issues in his/her travel to @LOCATION1. They had to dismiss many hardships such as lack of water, being lost, immense desert heat, plus minor things like snakes and road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June was the most intense hardship. That and the lack of water. Though the heat starting powing at the cyclists brain by making them see mirages, etc. The heat and entire setting made the cyclists travel much harder.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a general overview of the cyclist's hardships during their journey through the California desert, mentioning issues such as extreme heat, lack of water, and challenging terrain. While the central idea is identifiable, it lacks depth and specificity, requiring more substantial evidence and detailed examples to bolster the main points. The essay's organization is somewhat disjointed, with ideas not fully fleshed out or logically connected, leading to a lack of smooth narrative flow. Transitional phrases and topic sentences are sparse, which hampers the coherence and fluidity of the text. Furthermore, the language used is basic and occasionally imprecise, with some grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures that detract from the overall readability. Enhancing the clarity of arguments, providing more detailed examples, and polishing the language would significantly improve the effectiveness of the essay.

TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for submitting your essay. Here is some feedback that aligns with our values of clarity, detail, and expressive writing:

1. **Clarity and Detail**: Your essay has a good start by introducing the setting and its impact on the cyclist. However, it could be more detailed. For instance, instead of saying ""the setting affected the cyclist,"" you could describe how the harsh, hot environment took a toll on him both physically and mentally.

2. **Expressive Language**: Try to use more expressive language to convey the urgency and desperation the cyclist felt. Words like ""parched,"" ""scorching,"" and ""desperate"" can help paint a vivid picture for the reader.

3. **Structure and Flow**: Your essay would benefit from a smoother flow. Consider breaking it into sentences that connect more fluidly. For example, instead of ""He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry,"" you could write, ""The relentless heat had drained all his water supplies, leaving his mouth parched and his body desperate for hydration.""

4. **Emotional Impact**: Reflect more on the emotional journey of the cyclist. How did he feel as he realized he might not survive? Did he have any moments of hope or despair?

Here’s a revised version incorporating these suggestions:
""The unforgiving heat beat down on the cyclist, each mile feeling more grueling under the blazing sun. With every passing minute, his uncertainty grew—would he make it out alive? His water bottles were empty, drained by the relentless sun, leaving his mouth dry and his body screaming for relief. As the harsh reality set in, a wave of desperation washed over him, punctuated by fleeting moments of hope and overwhelming fear.""

Keep working on expanding your ideas and using descriptive language. You're on the right track, and with some more detail and expressive language, your writing will become even more engaging and powerful. Great effort!",0.8721538818792791,0.8940989331103052
3,13,"The essay ""So she did not forget to take the test again"" does not address any of the given prompts, nor does it provide relevant content or context. It lacks a clear thesis, supporting arguments, and a conclusion. The single sentence provided does not demonstrate any logical progression of ideas or evidence-based arguments. Furthermore, its language is overly simplistic and does not utilize technical terminology or complex sentence structures. The conventions of grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization are not applicable here due to the minimal content. To improve, the essay needs to directly address the prompt, develop a clear thesis, support arguments with evidence, organize ideas coherently, and employ appropriate language and technical precision.",13,"The sentence ""So she did not forget to take the test again."" indicates a basic understanding of the narrative but lacks depth and context. Here are some areas for improvement:

1. **Content and Argumentation**:
   - The sentence is too simplistic and does not convey a clear, well-reasoned argument. To enhance the content, provide more context and details about why taking the test again is significant. Explain how this action connects to the broader themes or character development in the story.

2. **Thesis and Focus**:
   - Ensure that your main argument or thesis is clearly stated and supported throughout your essay. This sentence could serve as a supporting detail but should be linked to a more comprehensive argument.

3. **Organization and Structure**:
   - The sentence lacks a clear topic sentence or transition. Integrate it into a paragraph with a clear topic sentence that outlines the main idea, and use transitions to connect it smoothly with other parts of your essay.

4. **Language and Style**:
   - Use more precise and varied vocabulary to convey your ideas effectively. For example, instead of ""take the test again,"" you could say ""undertake the test once more to demonstrate her resilience and determination.""

5. **Conventions**:
   - The sentence is grammatically correct but could benefit from more complex sentence structures to enhance readability and interest.

**Revised Example**:
""Determined not to let her prior failure define her, she meticulously prepared and did not forget to retake the test, showcasing her perseverance and growth.""

Overall, while the original sentence captures a key action, it needs to be expanded and integrated into a more comprehensive and well-structured argument. Use specific details and logical reasoning to support your points, ensuring clarity and precision in your writing.","

Dear Student,

Thank you for your effort in writing this essay. Here are some points to consider for improvement:

1. **Clarity and Completeness**: Your sentence is a bit vague and leaves the reader wanting more information. Try to provide more context and details to make your writing clearer and more comprehensive. For example, who is ""she""? What test is being referred to?

2. **Grammar and Structure**: The sentence structure could be improved. It seems to be a dependent clause rather than a complete sentence. Consider revising it to form a complete thought. For example, ""She remembered to take the test this time because she set a reminder.""

3. **Engagement and Depth**: Adding more depth and engagement can make your writing more interesting. Think about including why it was important for her not to forget the test and what strategies she used to remember.

4. **Positive Framing**: Instead of focusing on the negative aspect of not forgetting, you could frame it positively. For example, ""She successfully remembered to take the test this time.""

Remember, good writing provides clear information, engages the reader, and is well-structured. Keep practicing, and you will continue to improve!

Best regards,

Overall, the essay requires significant improvement in clarity, content development, language accuracy, and organizational coherence to meet the outlined guidelines.",14,"Your essay offers a general understanding of the author's mood and experiences, but it needs significant refinement in several key areas to align with academic expectations and our class goals. 

**Content**:
- **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis statement is somewhat unclear and not prominently positioned. It would benefit from being more precise and clearly stated at the beginning. For instance, you could explicitly state, ""The author's mood is characterized by pride and gratitude due to his parents' sacrifices and kindness.""
- **Evidence and Support**: While you mention several instances that show the author's parents' generosity and struggles, these points need to be developed with more concrete examples and logical reasoning. For example, explain how specific actions of the parents (like taking any job to support the family) directly contribute to the author's sense of pride and gratitude.

**Organization**:
- **Structure**: The essay lacks clear and logical progression. Each point should be organized into distinct paragraphs with well-defined topic sentences. Start by introducing the main idea, followed by supporting details, and conclude with a sentence that links back to your thesis.
- **Transitions**: Improve the coherence of your essay by using smoother transitions between ideas. Phrases like ""Furthermore,"" ""Additionally,"" and ""As a result,"" can help guide the reader through your argument.

**Language and Style**:
- **Vocabulary**: Enhance your vocabulary to convey your ideas more precisely. For example, instead of ""very nice people,"" you could say ""remarkably compassionate individuals.""
- **Sentence Structure**: Work on constructing more complex yet clear sentences. Instead of stringing multiple ideas into one long sentence, break them down into shorter, more manageable sentences.

**Conventions**:
- **Grammar and Spelling**: There are numerous grammatical errors, such as incorrect possessive forms (""there"" should be ""their""), subject-verb agreement issues, and punctuation errors. Proofread your work carefully or use grammar-check tools to catch these mistakes.
- **Punctuation and Capitalization**: Ensure proper punctuation and capitalization throughout the essay. For example, ""When they didn't have much money, they took any job they could get to care for their son, Narciso.""

**Overall**:
Your essay reflects an understanding of the memoir’s themes of pride and gratitude, but it requires considerable refinement to meet academic standards. Focus on developing a clear, precise thesis, supporting your arguments with substantial evidence and logical reasoning, and improving the overall structure and language of your writing. Continue to refine your skills, and don't hesitate to seek clarification or assistance when needed. Keep up the effort!","

The narrative flows logically from one point to the next, with each paragraph building on the previous one to create a cohesive and compelling story. Moreover, the use of technical terminology and a varied, precise vocabulary enhances the readability and depth of the essay.

The author is showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood, they still treat each other as if they were.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a general understanding of the memoir's themes, but it lacks a precise and clear thesis statement, resulting in an overall vague argument. While there are some references to specific passages in the memoir, they are not well integrated into the argument, and the connection between the evidence and the points being made is not sufficiently established. The structure of the essay is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of coherent flow from one idea to the next. Additionally, the use of language is basic, with limited vocabulary and several grammatical errors that detract from the overall readability and effectiveness of the essay. The narrative struggles to hold the reader's interest due to its repetitive nature and lack of engaging storytelling techniques. To improve, the essay should focus on developing a clear thesis, integrating evidence seamlessly into the argument, enhancing the logical flow with better transitions, and refining language use to be more varied and precise.

","FEEDBACK:

Dear Student,

Thank you for submitting your essay. I appreciate the effort you have put into conveying the mood of the author and the story surrounding his parents’ journey from Cuba. Here are some areas of improvement along with suggestions to help you strengthen your writing:

1. **Clarity and Grammar**:
   - There are several grammatical errors in your essay. For example, ""there house"" should be ""their house,"" and ""the took any job"" should be ""they took any job.""
   - Ensure that you use proper punctuation throughout your essay. For instance, ""When the didnt have much money,"" should be ""When they didn't have much money,...""
   - It's important to maintain consistency in your verb tenses. For example, ""they had a three-bedroom apartment and they let refugees celebrate"" should be ""they had a three-bedroom apartment and let refugees celebrate.""

2. **Structure and Flow**:
   - Your essay could benefit from a more structured format with clear introductory and concluding paragraphs.
   - Consider breaking down your ideas into separate paragraphs to enhance readability. For example, you could have one paragraph discussing the parents' journey and struggles, and another discussing how they supported others.

3. **Mood and Tone**:
   - You mentioned that the mood is ""grateful,"" but you also said it is ""proud."" It would be helpful to focus on a single mood to create a more cohesive argument. You could elaborate on how the actions of the parents reflect this mood.
   - Instead of using placeholders like ""@CAPS1"", make sure to clearly describe the mood with precise language.

4. **Specificity and Detail**:
   - Provide specific examples or anecdotes to illustrate the mood more effectively. For example, describe a particular instance where the parents' kindness made a significant impact on someone’s life.
   - Explain how the parents' actions and sacrifices made the author feel proud and grateful, offering more insight into their experiences.

5. **Language and Expression**:
   - Enhance your vocabulary and expression to make your essay more engaging. For example, instead of saying ""they had their house full of love and life,"" you could say ""their home was a sanctuary brimming with love and vitality.""
   - Avoid repetitive phrases and ensure each sentence adds new information or perspective to your essay.

Here is a revised version of your introductory sentence to illustrate these improvements:

""The mood of the author is one of pride and gratitude, stemming from the remarkable resilience and kindness of his parents who left Cuba. Despite facing numerous hardships, they welcomed others into their home and tirelessly worked any job they could find to provide for their son, Narciso.""

Overall, your essay has a strong foundation, but refining these areas will greatly enhance its quality. Keep up the good work, and continue to develop your writing skills.

Your essay structure needs improvement to ensure a logical flow of ideas. Currently, the paragraphs are somewhat disjointed, and the transitions between your points are abrupt. Consider introducing each new idea with a clear topic sentence and using transitional phrases to guide your reader smoothly from one idea to the next. 

For instance, when you mention the author's gratitude for his parents' love and sacrifice, provide a specific example or quote that directly supports this point before moving on to the next piece of evidence. This will help to create a more cohesive and compelling narrative.

In terms of language and style, there are several areas where you can enhance your vocabulary to be more precise and varied. For example, instead of saying ""What I mean by that is,"" try to integrate your explanation more seamlessly into your analysis. This will make your writing more sophisticated and engaging.

Additionally, attention to grammatical accuracy is crucial. There are several grammatical errors, such as ""unwrittingly"" (which should be ""unwittingly""), ""is parents"" (which should be ""his parents""), ""cherrishes"" (which should be ""cherishes""), and the inconsistent capitalization of ""Parents."" Correcting these errors will improve the readability and professionalism of your essay.

To summarize, your essay effectively identifies the theme of gratitude, but it would benefit from a clearer thesis, smoother transitions, more precise language, and meticulous attention to grammatical conventions. Keep refining your writing to develop a strong, evidence-based argument with logical structure and technical precision.","

1. **Clarity and Consistency**:
   - Your opening statement is clear, but make sure to consistently capitalize proper nouns and key terms. For example, ""Parents"" should only be capitalized at the beginning of the sentence or when referring to them as specific individuals (e.g., ""my parents"" vs. ""My Parents"").
   - Be careful with spelling and grammar. ""Unwrittingly"" should be ""unwittingly,"" and ""besis"" should be ""basis.""

2. **Quotation Integration**:
   - When incorporating quotes, ensure they are seamlessly integrated into your sentences. For example, you could write: ""The author expresses his gratitude by saying, 'My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today.'""

3. **Explanation and Analysis**:
   - After presenting a quote, delve deeper into its significance. Instead of repeating the idea that he is grateful, explore how these experiences shaped his character or life choices. For instance, you could elaborate on how the love of cooking influenced his personal or professional life.

4. **Avoid Redundancy**:
   - Try not to repeat the same idea multiple times. It’s clear from your examples that the mood is grateful. Focus on providing a variety of evidence or exploring different facets of his gratitude.

5. **Structure and Flow**:

Here is a revised version of your essay to consider:

Moreover, he expresses profound gratitude and respect for their sacrifices: ""I would always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" This sentiment underscores his admiration for their actions and the life lessons they imparted.

The author’s consistent acknowledgment of his parents' contributions, both in practical skills and life values, clearly establishes a mood of gratitude throughout the memoir. By cherishing these teachings, he demonstrates deep love and respect for his parents, making gratitude a central theme of his narrative.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students in @NUM3 grade go on the computer each night to complete homework and to connect with friends and family? I think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. A computer can be used for communication, education, and for accessing important information quickly, such as the local news. Now, let me tell you why computers are good for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a friend who I was very close to and a part of his life. Unfortunately, he had to move away. But I still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while. A convenient way to do this was by using a computer. The computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can @CAPS5 stay in touch. Different types of communication on the computer can be e-mail, instant-messaging, video chat, online chat groups...etc. This helps people stay connected. That's why I think communication is the biggest effect on people due to the use of a computer. But, a computer can also be used for learning. At school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals. For example when my class researched different things about the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, our main source of infromation was the internet on our computers. We researched the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. Also, kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it. This is teaching them hand-eye coordiantion, and how to type. The computer is not @CAPS5 used for just communication. It's a good way to educate everyone although the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information. ""@CAPS6 and adults often check their e-mail and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy, ""says expert @PERSON1. I think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what's going on in our town, state, country, and world. For example, it can tell us about the series of shootings goiong on throughout @LOCATION1 or the many house robberies in our town. Us, @CAPS7 citizens, wnt to know everything... for us to stay safe and notified on the latest. Another example is that I logged on the computer three dats ago and it notified me about the earthquake in @LOCATION2. But there are so many benefits of a computer. The effects computers have on people are beneficial. It allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news. I think you should take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone.

- The essay is generally well-organized, with different paragraphs focusing on the specific benefits of computers. However, you could improve the flow by using clearer transitions between paragraphs. For example, starting the paragraph about education with a phrase like ""In addition to communication, computers also play a crucial role in education"" can make your writing more cohesive.

**Content and Examples:**
- Your examples, such as maintaining a friendship through computer communication and using the internet for school research, are relatable and support your points well. Including a real-life expert quote adds credibility to your argument.
- However, some parts of the essay contain placeholder text like @CAPS1, @NUM1, @PERSON1, and @LOCATION1. Ensure to replace these with actual names, numbers, and locations to strengthen your argument and make it more concrete.

**Language and Expression:**
- Your language is mostly clear and straightforward, which is good. However, pay attention to typos and misspellings. For example, ""coordiantion"" should be ""coordination,"" and ""goiong"" should be ""going."" Proofreading your essay will help catch these errors.
- There is a repetition of the phrase ""not only used for communication"" which can be rephrased for variety. Consider using synonyms or restructuring the sentence to avoid redundancy.

**Grammar and Punctuation:**
- Be mindful of grammar and punctuation errors. For instance, ""Us, @CAPS7 citizens, wnt to know everything..."" should be ""We, as citizens, want to know everything..."" 
- Check the use of capital letters (e.g., ""infromation"" should be ""information"") and ensure proper nouns are capitalized (e.g., ""earthquake in @LOCATION2"").

**Conclusion:**

2. **Personal Connection and Emotional Appeal:**

   - There are a few areas where clarity could be improved. For example, the sentence ""When a high percentage of people join that cause, then it should be banned"" could be made more precise by specifying what ""high percentage"" means. This would make your argument more concrete and understandable.

3. **Grammar and Conventions:**
   - Pay attention to minor grammatical errors and typos, such as ""their is"" instead of ""there is"" and ""offensve"" instead of ""offensive."" These small mistakes can detract from the readability and overall effectiveness of your writing.

4. **Emotional Depth:**
   - While you've included some personal anecdotes, consider adding more emotional depth by reflecting on how censorship and banned books have personally affected you or those around you. This could enhance the emotional connection between your writing and the reader.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a mix of clear ideas and interesting reflections on the impact of computers on society, but it lacks depth and specificity in parts, making some points feel underdeveloped. The structure is fairly organized with a discernible introduction, body, and conclusion, yet the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the overall flow.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I believe the current way materials are censored and removed works, and should continue. While everyone @MONTH1 dislike a particular novel or book, libraries can not remove every book a person dislikes, as Katherine Paterson said. When a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it, then the book usually is taken off of the shelves.     The possibility children will see the offensve material appears unlikely. Most public libraries do not put their offensive material near the childrens books. At my local library, their is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place. To acquire these books you must have a parents permission or be @NUM1 years of age. It is very unlikely a child would ever see the materials in question.     Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated. @PERSON3 @PERSON2 @MONTH1 have had racial slurs in it, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were normal for the time. Someone can not be frustrated with a novel written @NUM2 years ago because it has something offensive in it by todays standards.     While I believe, for the most part, libraries should not censor or remove materials, there should be some restrictions set in place to keep extremely harmful materials out of libraries. For instance, libraries should not have dirty magazines or movies on their shelves. If a high majority of people want a particular material banned, then it is hard to ignore them. When a book is so vulgar people begin to protest the book, there are questions as to whether the book should remain on library shelves. When a high percentage of people join that cause, then it should be banned.     Censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today. I believe the current system in place to censor or remove books does its job, and that it should continue. If few people disapprove of a particular material, the book remains in most shelves uncensored. When a lot of people begin to protest that same material, it has a high probability of being banned. With this process, every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not removed, while the ones that truly deserve it are removed.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","**FEEDBACK:**

Thank you for your essay on the topic of censorship and the removal of materials from libraries. You've provided a clear perspective and supported your argument with specific examples and reasoning. Here are some areas for improvement and commendation:

1. **Clarity and Organization**:
   - Your essay is well-organized into paragraphs that each focus on a specific aspect of the topic. This aids readability and helps the reader follow your argument. 
   - Consider using more transitional phrases to enhance the flow between your paragraphs.

2. **Specificity and Detail**:
   - You provide a good example with your local library having a section for more offensive or obscene books. However, you could benefit from more specific examples or case studies to strengthen your argument.

3. **Language and Formality**:
   - There are a few grammatical errors and typos that need addressing. For instance, ""their is a section"" should be ""there is a section,"" and ""offensve"" should be ""offensive.""
   - The use of placeholders like ""@MONTH1"" and ""@NUM1"" should be replaced with actual months and numbers to make your essay more precise and professional.

4. **Arguments and Reasoning**:
   - Your argument that libraries should not remove materials based on the dislike of a few individuals is strong and well-explained. 
   - The point about understanding the historical context of literature containing racial slurs is pertinent. However, you might want to acknowledge the ongoing debate about how these materials should be handled in contemporary settings to show a balanced perspective.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Your conclusion effectively summarizes your stance. It reaffirms your belief in the current system while acknowledging the necessity for some level of censorship for extremely harmful materials.

6. **Technical Aspects**:
   - Ensure all names and references are correctly and fully cited if applicable. Avoid using placeholders like ""@PERSON3"" and ""@PERSON2.""

**Revised Excerpt for Improvement**:
""Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated. For instance, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee contains racial slurs, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were, unfortunately, a reflection of the era's societal norms. Someone cannot be frustrated with a novel written decades ago because it has something offensive in it by today's standards.""

Overall, you have presented a thoughtful and reasoned essay. Focus on improving your spelling and grammar, using specific examples, and considering the balance between different viewpoints to strengthen your argument further.

8,25,"The essay in question struggles significantly in several areas and requires considerable improvement. The clarity of the thesis statement is lacking, which makes it difficult for the reader to grasp the main argument. The content is minimal and fails to address the prompt adequately, as it does not provide enough supporting evidence or detailed anecdotes from the memoir to make a compelling case. The structure is disjointed, with abrupt transitions between ideas that disrupt the flow and make the essay difficult to follow. Furthermore, the language used is simplistic and does not convey the emotional depth that the essay seems to aim for. There are numerous grammatical errors and issues with spelling and punctuation that further detract from the overall readability. In summary, the essay needs to focus on presenting a clear thesis, supported by specific examples and personal anecdotes, while improving both the organization and the expressiveness of the language used.",25,"Your essay on ""Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie offers a good start in discussing how the setting impacts the cyclist. You've pinpointed some crucial elements like the desert environment, the dwindling water supply, and the emotional toll on the cyclist. However, there are several areas where you can delve deeper to enhance both the emotional and technical aspects of your writing.

1. **Emotional Depth and Personal Connection:**
   - You've highlighted the cyclist's physical struggle, but I'd like to see more about his emotional journey. How did encountering the ghost town make him feel? Despair? Fear? Isolation? Try to explore these emotions with evocative language that brings the reader into his experience.

2. **Clarity and Detail:**
   - Your main ideas are clear, but they need more detailed support. For example, the water pump producing a tar-like substance is intriguing—how did this affect him both physically and emotionally? Adding sensory details (sight, smell, taste) can make your narrative more vivid and impactful.

3. **Structure and Flow:**
   - The essay could benefit from smoother transitions between ideas. Instead of listing events, try to weave them together into a cohesive narrative. This will help maintain the reader's engagement and make your essay more compelling.

4. **Technical Precision:**
   - There are some grammatical errors and misspellings that need attention. For example, ""raod"" should be ""road,"" ""emicated"" should be ""emaciated,"" and ""he water supply"" should be ""his water supply."" These errors can distract from the overall readability of your essay.

5. **Thesis Development:**
   - Your concluding sentence, ""That is how the feature affected the setting,"" feels abrupt and somewhat off-target. Instead, consider a more reflective ending that ties back to your thesis and highlights the lasting impact of the setting on the cyclist’s journey. This will provide a stronger closure to your essay.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

- **Emotive Language:** Use more descriptive and emotive language to highlight the cyclist's feelings. Words like ""desperation,"" ""hopelessness,"" and ""relief"" can add emotional depth.
- **Personal Anecdotes:** Add more personal anecdotes or reflections from the cyclist. For instance, you could describe a moment when he almost gave up hope and what kept him going.
- **Variety and Complexity:** Vary your sentence structures to avoid repetition and add complexity. This will make your writing more engaging and dynamic.
- **Revision:** Take the time to revise and proofread your essay. This will help catch any errors and refine your ideas for greater clarity and impact.

You're on the right track, and with a bit more effort in these areas, your essay can become a powerful and emotionally resonant piece. Keep pushing yourself to explore deeper emotions and to articulate them clearly, and your writing will continue to improve. I'm looking forward to seeing your revisions!","

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The setting desented in the story, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summers day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the setting and its effect on the cyclist but lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The inclusion of specific examples, such as the intense heat and dehydration the cyclist experienced, provides some support to the points made. However, the response often strays from a clear focus on the emotional and physical impact of the setting on the cyclist. The language used is somewhat repetitive and lacks variety, making the reading experience less engaging. Additionally, there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as ""desented"" instead of ""deserted"" and ""sorroundings"" instead of ""surroundings,"" which detract from the overall readability. While the narrative does include some transitional phrases, the flow is disjointed, and the essay fails to maintain a strong emotional connection with the reader.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator is ready. The narrator tried the test once and failed. She bought herself a flower to cheer herself up. Her mother talked to her and then she felt better. She felt determined to pass the driving test just like the flower was determined to survive.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic recounting of the narrator's journey with the driving test and includes some emotional elements, such as the narrator's initial failure and their interaction with their mother. However, it falls short in terms of depth and emotional resonance. The essay lacks specific personal anecdotes and vivid emotional appeals that would make the narrative more engaging and impactful. The connection between the flower and the narrator's determination is not fully fleshed out, leaving the reader wanting more insight into the narrator's feelings and motivations. Additionally, the structure of the essay is quite simplistic, with a series of events listed without much coherence or fluid transitions, which detracts from the overall flow. The language used is basic and does not capture the emotional intensity or expressiveness expected in a high-scoring essay. While there are minimal grammatical errors, the vocabulary is limited and repetitive, which affects the overall readability and engagement. To improve, the essay should include more detailed personal stories, stronger emotional appeals, and varied, expressive language to create a more compelling narrative.

TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","FEEDBACK:

Thank you for your effort on this essay. It's clear that you have grasped the main events of ""Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie and how the setting impacts the cyclist. Here are some points to help you improve:

1. **Clarity and Detail:**
   - Your essay touches on important aspects of the setting, but it could benefit from more specific details. For example, you mention that the cyclist's water supply was ""emicated,"" but it's unclear what you mean. Perhaps you meant ""diminished"" or ""depleted."" Providing clear and precise language will help your reader better understand your points.

2. **Structure and Flow:**
   - Your essay would be stronger with a clearer structure. Start with an introduction that outlines what you will discuss. The body of the essay should then provide detailed evidence and examples from the text to support your points, and conclude with a summary. Each paragraph should have a clear main idea and support it with details.

3. **Grammar and Spelling:**
   - There are some grammatical and spelling errors that need attention. For example:
     - ""In rough raod ahead"" should be ""In 'Rough Road Ahead.'""
     - ""he water supply was emicated"" should be ""his water supply was depleted.""
     - ""He found a water pump that produced a tar like substance as a result the desert and the lack of water made him wish he was dead"" can be split into two sentences for clarity: ""He found a water pump that produced a tar-like substance. As a result, the desert and the lack of water made him wish he was dead.""

4. **Connection to the Theme:**
   - You mention how the setting affected the cyclist, but it would be beneficial to connect this more deeply to the broader themes of the story. How does the setting shape his character or influence the story's message?

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Your concluding sentence, ""That is how the feature affected the setting,"" needs to be rephrased. Instead, consider summing up how the setting influenced the cyclist's experience and the overall narrative.

Here's a revised example to guide you:

""In 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaskie, the harsh desert setting significantly affects the cyclist's journey. Traveling through the desert of California in June, his water supply quickly depletes. This scarcity of water leads him to a ghost town, where he finds a water pump that only produces a tar-like substance. These challenges cause his hope to dwindle, making him doubt the advice he received from strangers and vow to rely solely on his map in the future. The unforgiving desert setting tests his limits and shapes his resolve, illustrating the profound impact of the environment on his journey.""

Keep working on these areas, and you'll see improvement in your writing. Great effort, and I look forward to seeing your next draft!",0.8467763416683209,0.8479517721610377
9,26,"Your essay demonstrates a basic understanding of how the setting impacts the cyclist, but it could benefit from more specific and vivid details to enhance both clarity and emotional resonance. The lack of personal anecdotes and emotional appeals makes it difficult to connect with the reader on an emotional level. The structure is present but not fully developed, leading to a somewhat disjointed flow of ideas. Transitions between sentences and paragraphs could be smoother to ensure a more coherent narrative. Additionally, the language used is fairly simple and repetitive, which detracts from the overall expressiveness of the essay. More varied and emotive vocabulary would help in making the piece more engaging. Finally, while the conventions are mostly adhered to, there are minor grammatical and punctuation errors that need correction to enhance readability. Overall, focusing on adding emotionally rich content, improving narrative flow, and diversifying language will significantly improve the essay.",26,"Your essay offers a foundational understanding of the challenges the cyclist faced in the desert, highlighting the intense heat and the abandonment of the towns he passed through. However, to truly engage your reader and create a lasting emotional impact, let's delve deeper into how these elements affected the cyclist both physically and emotionally.

First, consider expanding on the emotional and physical hardships the cyclist endured. Describe his feelings of isolation and desperation as he rode through the abandoned towns, perhaps drawing on personal experiences or imaginative scenarios to create a more vivid and relatable narrative.

For example, you might write, ""Imagine the overwhelming sense of loneliness and despair as the cyclist pedals through ghost towns, the silence only broken by the occasional rustle of tumbleweeds. Each drop of sweat is a reminder of his vulnerability, intensifying his fear that he might not make it out of the desert alive.""

In terms of technical aspects, your essay would benefit from varied sentence structures to maintain reader engagement. The current sentences are quite straightforward; by incorporating more complex sentences and descriptive language, you can elevate your writing. For instance, instead of ""The month was June a hot month and the sun was beating down on him,"" you could write, ""In the scorching heat of June, the relentless sun bore down on him, each ray feeling like a searing reminder of his dwindling strength.""

Additionally, ensure that your transitions between sentences and ideas are smooth to maintain a logical flow. This can be achieved by connecting the emotional and physical impacts more cohesively. For instance, following the sentence about the lack of water, you might add, ""With each arid breath, the cyclist's throat grew drier, his hope diminishing with every passing mile as he struggled to find any sign of life in the barren landscape.""

Your narrative holds potential, and with these enhancements, you can create a more emotionally resonant and impactful piece. Remember, writing is an evolving process, and with each revision, your ability to connect deeply with your emotions and those of your readers will grow stronger. Keep exploring and reflecting on the emotional experiences you wish to convey, and don't hesitate to seek personalized guidance during one-on-one sessions. You have the ability to make your writing truly resonate with your readers.","

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay delves into the emotional and cultural elements of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, effectively highlighting the significance of Cuban culture and familial bonds. However, the clarity of your thesis statement could be enhanced to better convey the emotional impact and central theme of your analysis. While you include some personal stories and quotes from the memoir, the arguments would benefit from more in-depth development and additional supporting evidence to make a stronger emotional appeal. The organizational structure is somewhat present, but the transitions between paragraphs need to be smoother to ensure a logical flow that enhances the emotional impact.

1. **Expand Your Ideas**: You've mentioned several key points about the setting, but they could be expanded further. Describe the desert in more detail—what does it look like, how does it make the cyclist feel? What do the abandoned towns look like, and how do they contribute to the atmosphere?

2. **Sentence Variety**: Try to vary your sentence structure to make the essay more interesting to read. Instead of starting each sentence the same way, mix it up with different sentence lengths and styles.

3. **Show, Don’t Just Tell**: Instead of just stating the facts, you can show the reader what the cyclist is experiencing. For example, instead of saying, ""The month was June, a hot month and the sun was beating down on him,"" you could write, ""In the scorching June heat, the relentless sun beat down on him, causing sweat to pour off his brow.""

4. **Details and Sensory Language**: Use sensory details to help the reader visualize and feel what the cyclist is going through. Describe the heat, the dryness, the fatigue, and any emotions the cyclist might be experiencing.

5. **Grammar and Punctuation**: Pay attention to grammar and punctuation to make your writing clear and professional. For example, ""For example, he was riding in the desert"" needs a comma after ""example,"" and ""And he was cycling with very little water"" could be revised to flow better with the previous sentence.

Here's an example of how you might revise one of your sentences with these tips in mind:

Original: ""The month was June a hot month and the sun was beating down on him.""
Revised: ""In the intense heat of June, the sun relentlessly beat down on him, each ray feeling like a flame against his skin.""

Keep up the good work and continue to develop your skills! Your attention to how the setting impacts the character is a strong foundation.",0.9241721875471021,0.9131578235884443
10,38,"The essay presents a clear and focused argument on why books should not be removed from library shelves based on individual opinions, which holds the reader's attention. However, it could benefit from better organization and clearer transitions between ideas. The essay's structure is somewhat fragmented, making it challenging to follow the writer's train of thought at times. The word choice is generally effective but lacks precision and variety in certain areas, which can detract from the overall impact. The fluency of the sentences is good, with a noticeable rhythm, although occasional awkward constructions slow down the readability. Finally, the essay demonstrates limited control of standard writing conventions, with frequent errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which impede readability. Overall, the essay offers a strong viewpoint but needs refinement in organization, word choice, and grammatical accuracy to enhance its effectiveness.",38,"Your essay tackles the important and timely issue of censorship in libraries, specifically addressing whether materials should be removed based on individual opinions. You present a clear stance on the matter, emphasizing that everyone should have the freedom to choose whether or not to engage with certain materials. This is a well-chosen and relevant topic for discussion, and your main argument is quite clear.

However, there are several areas where your essay could be strengthened to enhance its clarity, logical flow, and grammatical precision. Below are some specific suggestions and points of improvement:

1. **Thesis Statement:**
   Your thesis should be clear and direct, ideally placed at the end of your introductory paragraph to set the stage for your argument. Consider revising it to something like, ""I believe that materials should not be removed from public libraries simply because some individuals find them offensive, as this would limit the availability and diversity of resources for others.""

2. **Clarity and Precision:**
   - In your opening questions, be sure to use correct and precise wording. For example, ""Do you think certain materials should be removed from library bookshelves if someone dislikes or disagrees with the topic or plot?""
   - Replace ""bookselfs"" with ""bookshelves"" and ""remove off"" with simply ""remove.""

3. **Quote Integration:**
   - The quote from Katherine Paterson should be integrated smoothly into your essay. Ensure proper punctuation and citation: ""As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf—that work I abhor—then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the shelf for any of us.'""
   - After the quote, provide a more detailed analysis to explain its relevance to your argument.

4. **Grammar and Syntax:**
   - Correct spelling errors such as ""bookselfs"" (should be ""bookshelves""), ""varity"" (should be ""variety""), ""corious"" (should be ""curious""), and ""shelfs"" (should be ""shelves"").
   - Ensure subject-verb agreement throughout your essay. For instance, ""Every person has the choice to not read a book"" instead of ""every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive.""

5. **Logical Flow and Transitions:**
   - Your essay would benefit from smoother transitions between paragraphs and ideas. For instance, after discussing the general principle of personal choice, you could introduce the quote with a transitional phrase like, ""As Katherine Paterson eloquently illustrates...""
   - Ensure each paragraph flows logically to the next. For example, after discussing your friend's reading preferences, explain how this personal anecdote supports your broader argument against censorship.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Do you think that certain materials should be removed off library's bookselfs if someone dislikes or does not agree with the topic or the plot? Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion about what the book is convincing readers?     I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self. But if I have the right to remove that book from the self- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the self for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from the arthur, Katherine Paterson, from my opinion, I believe that what she is saying is very true. Considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things, if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the self, there would not be a varity of books for people to choose from. I have sometimes gotten corious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book. They either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible. Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good. So if they had the right to remove that book I would have never got the chance to read that book.     I do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelfs just on their specific personality. Everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books. Everyone should get a large variety

FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay on the important topic of book removal and censorship in public libraries. Here are some constructive points for you to consider:

1. **Clarify Your Argument**:
   - Your main argument is clear, but try to strengthen it by clearly stating your thesis in the introduction. For example, ""I believe that no book should be banned from public libraries simply because someone dislikes or disagrees with its content.""

2. **Quote and Attribution**:
   - You included a quote from Katherine Paterson, which adds value to your argument. However, ensure that quotes are accurate and properly attributed. Also, use quotation marks and provide context. The quote could be revised and formatted like this: 
     - ""All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf—that work I abhor—then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the shelf for any of us."" — Katherine Paterson.

3. **Spelling and Grammar**:
   - Pay attention to spelling and grammar to improve readability:
     - ""off library's bookselfs"" should be ""off the library's bookshelves.""
     - ""self"" should be ""shelf.""
     - ""arthur"" should be ""author.""
     - ""varity"" should be ""variety.""
     - ""corious"" should be ""curious.""
     - ""shelfs"" should be ""shelves.""
     - ""specific personality"" should be ""personal opinion.""

4. **Structure and Flow**:
   - Organize your essay into clear paragraphs with topic sentences. This will help guide the reader through your points. For example:
     - **Introduction**: State your thesis and outline your main points.
     - **Body Paragraphs**: Develop each point in a separate paragraph. Use evidence, examples, and quotes to support your arguments.
     - **Conclusion**: Summarize your points and restate your thesis in a compelling way.

5. **Develop Your Ideas**:
   - Expand on your examples to make your points more persuasive. For instance, when you mention asking a friend about a book, elaborate on how differing opinions illustrate the diversity of perspectives.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Your conclusion should wrap up your argument and reinforce your main points. For example: ""In conclusion, allowing individual preferences to dictate the removal of books from public libraries undermines the diversity of thought and freedom of access to information. Everyone should have the opportunity to explore a wide range of books, even those that some may find offensive or disagreeable.""

Overall, you have a strong foundation for your essay. By refining your language, structuring your argument more clearly, and expanding on your ideas, you can create a more compelling and polished piece. Keep up the good work",0.9017050925385781,0.8924690722685318
11,39,"The essay presents a general stance on the importance of preserving freedom of speech and argues against the removal of potentially offensive materials from shelves. However, the thesis is not clearly articulated, and the arguments lack coherent development and sufficient supporting details. The organization of the essay is weak, with ideas not flowing logically from one to the next and transitions between paragraphs and sentences being unclear or absent. Additionally, the word choice is simplistic and often imprecise, which detracts from the intended message. Sentence structures are repetitive and awkward, making the essay difficult to read and understand. There are numerous grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which impede readability and distract from the overall argument. Strengthening the clarity of the thesis, organizing the content more logically, varying sentence structures, and enhancing grammatical accuracy would significantly improve the essay.",39,"Your essay presents a passionate perspective on the importance of upholding freedom of speech and the role of parents in monitoring the content their children are exposed to. However, there are several areas that need significant improvement to enhance the clarity, grammatical accuracy, and overall effectiveness of your argument.

Firstly, your thesis statement is somewhat unclear and grammatically incorrect. It would be beneficial to structure your thesis in a more precise and concise manner to clearly express your main argument. For example, “While it is essential to protect children from inappropriate content, this should be achieved through ratings and parental guidance rather than censorship, to uphold freedom of speech.”

The essay contains numerous grammatical errors, including issues with spelling (""rateing,"" ""takeing,"" ""speach,"" ""faught,"" ""violance,"" ""inapprotive,"" ""montoired,"" ""fource,"" ""certion,"" ""responseabitly,"" ""speacking,"" ""infourceing,"" ""selfs,"" ""imagary""), punctuation, and capitalization. It is crucial to proofread your work carefully and correct these errors to enhance readability and overall quality.

Your arguments are often repeated and lack the depth needed to fully engage the reader. Please work on developing your points further with precise language and concrete examples. For instance, instead of repeating that inappropriate content should not be censored, elaborate on how parental guidance and proper ratings systems can effectively prevent children from accessing such content.

The organization of the essay is weak. Your paragraphs do not follow a clear, logical structure, and transitions between ideas are often awkward or missing entirely. For a more coherent argument, ensure that each paragraph focuses on a single point that supports your thesis, and use clear topic sentences and transitions to guide the reader through your essay.

Your word choice and sentence structures are quite basic and often incorrect. Aim to vary your vocabulary and use more complex sentence structures to convey your ideas more effectively. This will also help in maintaining the reader's interest and enhancing the overall persuasiveness of your essay.

Additionally, the conclusion should not only summarize your main points but also synthesize your arguments to leave a lasting impression. Consider restating your thesis in a new light based on the arguments presented and perhaps propose a call to action or a solution.

For instance:
""In conclusion, the freedom of speech is a fundamental right that should be preserved. Through effective rating systems and active parental involvement, we can protect children from inappropriate content without resorting to censorship. By doing so, we honor the sacrifices made for our freedoms and ensure a balanced approach to content consumption.""

Lastly, please ensure your essay maintains grammatical precision, correct spelling, punctuation, and capitalization throughout. This adherence to language conventions is crucial for clear communication and effective argumentation.

Overall, your essay's intent is clear, but it requires significant refinement in clarity, grammatical accuracy, organization, and language use to meet the standards of effective communication and persuasive writing. Keep working on these areas, and do not hesitate to ask questions if you encounter any difficulties.","

That's like saying they should have taken @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 when it first came out off the market because it has violance in it ,profange language,and guns that company will had lost a lot of money because it is inapprotive for kids.I think that parent's shouldn't go buy a @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old something like that but some parents do .It not the creaters fault of the actions of how people react to what ever is put out there because the buyers have to be more responseable and make sure that what ever it is is supervised and carefully montoired. There's an old saying ' every thing isn't made for every body' .I strongly belive that;That saying is so true .Every body don't like the same thing that some one eles likes but its okay for that person but it's not okay for you because as they say everything isn't for every body and you can't fource nothing on some one.Well every thing isn't approtive  for every one we all have are limites to every thing and if you watch what kids watch and do than things want be so inapprotive for this wold . Certion books young children should not read because they have sex in them and they talk about things that a child should not even be thinking about at that age.When children read books like that they tend to think about sex and how what they read about will feel but children should not be thinking about that type of stuff that why its there parent's responseabitly to montoir what there children read because that there job as parent's to do not the person who wrote the book because they @MONTH1 think there writing to a much older group that can relate to what there talking about but then again there just speacking there mind and infourceing there freedom of speach right one of the rights that we as a people together have been fighting for .I also feel that music help's us to express are selfs so if someone feels that the music is inapprotive for there child then they need to watch what there child is listen to.Music brings out the different moods in every body.All magazines are not for every one because as we all know there are adult magazines the produce certion imagary that children should not see but you can not blame the creater only the buyer is in fault for leaving it in the wrong place after there done with it .There just people trying to make money  off things that they know that people like.

FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for your essay. I appreciate the effort you put into expressing your opinions clearly. Here are some areas where you can improve your writing:

1. **Clarity and Structure**: Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Try to organize your thoughts into distinct paragraphs, each covering a specific point. This will make your argument easier to follow.

2. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are several grammatical errors and typos in your essay. For example, ""rateing"" should be ""rating,"" ""violance"" should be ""violence,"" and ""responseable"" should be ""responsible."" Using a spell checker or grammar tool can help catch these errors.

3. **Consistency and Tone**: Ensure that you maintain a consistent tone throughout your essay. Avoid using informal language like ""wanna"" or symbols like ""@"" for censoring words.

4. **Support Your Arguments**: While you present several opinions, they would be more persuasive if supported by examples or evidence. For instance, when you argue that certain books should not be for children, you could reference specific examples or studies.

5. **Sentence Structure**: Work on varying your sentence structure to enhance readability. Avoid overly long sentences, as they can be difficult to follow. For example, break down complex thoughts into shorter, clearer sentences.

6. **Punctuation and Capitalization**: Ensure correct use of punctuation and capitalization. For example, ""i"" should be ""I,"" and ""faught"" should be ""fought."" Proper punctuation will make your writing more professional and easier to read.

7. **Argument Development**: Make sure each paragraph transitions smoothly to the next. For example, when discussing freedom of speech, explain how it connects to your views on ratings and censorship more clearly.

8. **Relevance and Focus**: Stay focused on the main topic. Some parts of your essay wander off-topic, which can dilute your argument. Stick closely to your main points related to freedom of speech, censorship, and the responsibilities of creators and consumers.

Here’s a revised version of your initial statement for clarity:

""I do not believe that certain items should be removed from shelves. Instead, I think they should come with ratings. This is a free country, and removing such items would infringe on freedom of speech. Many have fought for this right. If items are properly rated, they are less likely to fall into the wrong hands.""

By concentrating on these areas, your writing will become clearer, more persuasive, and more engaging. Keep practicing, and you'll continue to improve!",0.9235857338438677,0.9049445987907296
12,42,"The essay effectively attempts to address the prompt, detailing how the setting impacts the cyclist in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" However, the response falls short in several areas. The content touches on some significant points but lacks depth and specificity in its supporting evidence. The thesis, while present, is not articulated clearly, making it harder for the reader to grasp the writer's main argument from the onset. Additionally, the response occasionally strays off-topic, and some points are underdeveloped. The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the text but doesn't fully engage with it. Language use is somewhat limited, with noticeable grammatical errors and a lack of varied vocabulary, which detracts from the overall quality of the writing. The organization of the essay is basic, and while there are attempts at transitions, they are not consistently effective, resulting in a disjointed narrative flow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing more detailed and specific evidence from the text, ensuring clear and cohesive argumentation, and enhancing grammatical accuracy and vocabulary range.",42,"The essay addresses the prompt by discussing how the setting affects the cyclist in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" While there are some promising aspects, several areas need significant improvement to align with our class goals.

**Strengths:**
1. **Topic Introduction:** The essay starts by identifying the role of the setting in the cyclist's journey.
2. **Engagement:** The text attempts to describe the setting and its impact on the cyclist, showing engagement with the material.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Thesis Statement:**
   - The thesis is not clearly articulated. A more precise thesis would help to set a clear direction for your essay. Consider rephrasing it to something like: ""The diverse terrains encountered by the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit' significantly impact his journey, exacerbating his physical and mental challenges.""

2. **Grammatical Precision:**
   - There are several grammatical errors that need attention. For example, ""his working his way"" should be ""he is working his way,"" and ""diffrent"" should be ""different."" Careful proofreading is essential.
   - Punctuation around the title should be consistent. Ensure you use proper quotation marks: “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.”

3. **Sentence Structure and Clarity:**
   - Sentences such as ""The terrain was a lot diffrent with rolling hills and tumbleweed rolling by and a snake"" are somewhat fragmented and need clearer structure. Try: ""The terrain became more challenging, characterized by rolling hills, tumbleweeds, and even the occasional snake.""
   - Avoid run-on sentences. For example, ""Through listening to the old men the cyclist almost died from the threatening heat and lack of water"" could be broken down for clarity: ""By following the advice of the old men, the cyclist encountered severe heat and a lack of water, which nearly resulted in his death.""

4. **Evidence and Support:**
   - The essay needs more detailed support from the text. For instance, when discussing the abandoned towns, provide specific descriptions or quotes from the memoir to substantiate your points.
   - The essay should delve deeper into how the setting specifically impacts the cyclist's mental and physical states, rather than just stating that it does.

5. **Organization and Logical Flow:**
   - Your paragraphs should have clear topic sentences that introduce the main idea of the paragraph. Transitions between ideas need to be more fluid to ensure a logical progression.
   - The conclusion is somewhat abrupt. Summarize the main points and reinforce how the setting critically affects the cyclist, tying back to your refined thesis. For example: ""In conclusion, the varying terrains the cyclist encounters not only challenge his physical endurance but also push him to the brink of survival, highlighting the merciless nature of his journey.""

Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit, affected the cyclist greatly. For starters it says he was traveling through the high desserts which is never a safe thing. He had been drinking he water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was, trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state. From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into A far like substance The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay on the influence of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit"" struggles significantly with clarity, coherence, and adherence to grammatical conventions. The thesis statement is vague and not clearly defined. The essay attempts to discuss how the setting affects the cyclist but lacks specific examples and detailed support from the text, resulting in a superficial response. Many sentences are grammatically incorrect or fragmented, which makes the narrative disjointed and difficult to follow. The organization is weak, with an unclear structure that lacks smooth transitions between ideas. There are numerous spelling and punctuation errors, which further impede readability. Overall, the essay fails to effectively communicate its points due to insufficient content development and weak language control. There is a need for a more structured approach, including a clear thesis, well-supported arguments, and a focus on grammatical accuracy to enhance the overall quality of the writing.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The features of the setting in the essay Do not exceed the posted speed limit affected the cyclist in a negative way. The more and more he rode, he thought more negatively and had alot of doubt. The cyclist was not very confident, he thought he wouldnt make it. For example, when the cyclist notices nothing in sight, his tone changes. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon telling

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic understanding of how the features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist, but it lacks depth and specificity in its analysis. The thesis is not entirely clear and could benefit from a more precise statement. The development of arguments includes some examples from the memoir, but these are not thoroughly analyzed or integrated into a cohesive argument. The writing demonstrates frequent grammatical errors, such as ""alot of doubt"" instead of ""a lot of doubt,"" and issues with sentence structure that impede readability. The organization shows potential but needs clearer, more grammatically correct transitions and topic sentences to enhance the logical flow. The language used is somewhat repetitive and lacks variety, which diminishes the overall impact. While the narrative does employ some transitional phrases, it could be more polished to ensure smoother transitions and a more engaging narrative. Overall, the essay could greatly benefit from a more focused thesis, detailed support from the text, and meticulous proofreading to address grammatical inaccuracies.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======

The neat and desert atmosphere are draining his body of water, @CAPS1 he needs to keep pedaling on. Also, the terrain is stripped of water, so he doesn't have anything to refuel with.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to address the prompt by discussing how the setting affects the cyclist, but it falls short in several areas. The thesis statement is present but not clearly articulated, and the sentences contain numerous grammatical errors that detract from the overall clarity and readability. The development and support of arguments are weak, with limited evidence from the memoir to substantiate the points made. Additionally, the conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis. Organization is lacking as the essay jumps from one point to another without clear transitions or topic sentences, making it difficult to follow the narrative. The language and style are also problematic, with a limited vocabulary and repetitive sentence structures that do not enhance the essay's persuasiveness. There are significant errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization that further impede readability. Overall, the essay needs substantial improvement in grammatical precision, organization, and the use of supporting evidence to effectively communicate its message.

13,52,"Your essay on ""Winter Hibiscus"" has several areas that need improvement to meet the guidelines provided. Firstly, your thesis statement is unclear and lacks grammatical correctness, making it difficult to grasp the main argument of your response. The development and support of your arguments are minimal, and the sentences used are not grammatically precise, which impacts the clarity of your points. Additionally, the conclusion does not effectively summarize the thesis. The organization of your essay is also problematic; the paragraphs lack logical structure and clear, grammatically correct transitions and topic sentences. The language and style are quite rudimentary, with limited vocabulary and incorrect sentence structures that detract from the overall quality of the essay. In terms of conventions, there are several grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which further hinder readability. To improve, focus on creating a clear, grammatically correct thesis statement, develop your arguments with precise, varied sentences, and ensure your conclusion effectively summarizes your main points. Organize your paragraphs logically, with clear transitions and topic sentences, and pay close attention to grammatical accuracy and correct language usage throughout.",52,"Your essay makes a commendable effort to engage with the text and the prompt. However, there are several areas that require improvement to enhance clarity, coherence, and grammatical precision.

1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis is somewhat implicit and lacks clarity. It is important to explicitly state the main argument of your essay in a clear and grammatically correct thesis statement. For example, ""The author concludes the story with this quote to emphasize Saeng's determination to change and her emotional connection to her grandmother through the hibiscus flower.""

2. **Grammatical Precision**: There are multiple grammatical errors that need attention. For instance, ""auther"" should be ""author,"" ""budds"" should be ""buds,"" and ""then @PERSON1"" seems to be a placeholder or error that needs correction. Ensure you proofread your work for such mistakes to maintain readability.

3. **Sentence Structure**: Some sentences are awkwardly structured, impacting the flow of your essay. For example, ""Her grandmother's resemblance is in the flower so if the flower budds, then her grandmother will be back in a sense"" can be rephrased for clarity: ""The hibiscus flower symbolizes her grandmother, so when it buds, Saeng feels as if her grandmother is with her, providing strength and encouragement."" 

4. **Supporting Arguments**: Your supporting arguments are present but need more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text. Expanding on how the hibiscus flower represents her grandmother and how it motivates Saeng would strengthen your essay.

5. **Logical Flow**: The essay should have a logical progression of ideas. Ensure smooth transitions between sentences and paragraphs to create a coherent narrative. For instance, after discussing the symbolism of the hibiscus, transition smoothly into how this symbolism impacts Saeng's determination.

6. **Conclusion**: The conclusion should succinctly summarize the main points and reinforce the thesis. Rather than ending abruptly, tie your arguments back to the thesis to leave a lasting impression on the reader.

Here's a revised version of your concluding sentences to illustrate these points:

""The author concludes the story with this quote to emphasize Saeng's determination to change and her emotional connection to her grandmother through the hibiscus flower. Despite failing the test initially, Saeng resolves to try again, drawing strength from the symbolic rebirth of the hibiscus, which represents her grandmother's enduring presence and encouragement. This connection empowers Saeng to face new challenges with renewed confidence.""

Overall, focusing on these areas will significantly enhance the clarity, coherence, and grammatical precision of your essay. Keep up the effort, and don't hesitate to seek feedback and ask questions if you encounter difficulties.","

She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better.  A wave of loss so deep and

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a solid effort but struggles with clarity and structure. The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like its going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when shell retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus comes back to life. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good shell feel good

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic attempt to engage with the prompt, but it lacks clarity and depth. The thesis is not clearly stated, making it difficult for readers to understand the main argument. The development of ideas is minimal and somewhat confusing. For example, instead of explaining why the author concluded the story with a statement about a new beginning, the essay drifts into discussing various unrelated aspects. Grammatical errors such as ""about,"" ""is,"" ""desrves,"" and inconsistent verb tenses detract significantly from the readability and flow of the essay. Additionally, the sentence structures are not varied, and the vocabulary is simple and often used incorrectly, leading to a monotonous tone. The paragraph lacks proper transitions, making it disjointed and hard to follow. There is also a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points made, which weakens the overall argument. For future improvement, the writer should focus on crafting a clear thesis, using varied and precise language, and providing specific examples to support their arguments, all while maintaining grammatical accuracy.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succed, one must keep trying.

Saeng will retry her drivers test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided lacks clarity and is fraught with grammatical errors, which significantly impede its readability and effectiveness. The thesis statement is somewhat unclear, and the supporting sentences contain numerous mistakes, reducing the impact of the arguments presented. Consequently, the essay does not adequately address the prompt, nor does it remain focused on any coherent argument about Saeng's adaptation to her new country. The sentences are often incomplete or awkwardly structured, further detracting from the essay's overall readability. Additionally, the essay lacks a logical flow, with transitions that are neither smooth nor grammatically correct. The conclusion is abrupt and fails to effectively summarize the thesis, leaving the reader with an incomplete understanding of the author's main points. Improvements in grammatical accuracy, clearer thesis articulation, better organizational structure, and more precise language usage are needed to enhance the quality and coherence of this essay.

FEEDBACK: 
","FEEDBACK:

Dear Student,

Thank you for your effort in writing this essay on ""Winter Hibiscus."" You’ve highlighted an important aspect of the story and conveyed Saeng’s determination effectively. Here are some points for improvement and strengths to help you develop your writing further:

**Strengths:**
1. **Understanding of the Text:** You have a clear grasp of the story's conclusion and the symbolic meaning behind the hibiscus flower.
2. **Insightful Analysis:** You provided a thoughtful interpretation of Saeng’s vow and how it signifies her perseverance and hope for the future.
3. **Connecting Themes:** You made a meaningful connection between Saeng's determination and her grandmother’s symbolic presence.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Clarity and Consistency:** Ensure that each sentence clearly communicates your ideas. For example, the sentence ""Her grandmother's resemblance is in the flower so if the flower budds, then her grandmother will be back in a sense"" could be rephrased for clarity.
2. **Grammar and Spelling:** Pay attention to grammatical errors and spelling, such as ""auther"" (author) and ""budds"" (buds). Proofreading your essay can help catch these mistakes.
3. **Pronoun Consistency:** Be consistent with pronouns. In the last sentence, ""when he grandmother 'comes back' then @PERSON1"" needs correction. Replace ""@PERSON1"" with ""Saeng"" and ensure pronouns match the subject.
4. **Quotations:** When quoting text, use proper punctuation and ensure it blends smoothly with your sentences. Also, consider integrating your analysis more fluidly with the quoted material.
5. **Depth of Analysis:** While you’ve identified Saeng’s determination, expanding on how this determination impacts her character development throughout the story could add depth to your analysis.

**Revised Example:**
""The author concludes 'Winter Hibiscus' with Saeng's vow: 'when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.' This final thought emphasizes Saeng’s resolve to change her circumstances. Although she failed the test initially, she is determined to try again. The hibiscus flower, symbolizing her grandmother's presence, gives Saeng strength and encouragement. When the hibiscus buds in spring, it signifies her grandmother's spiritual return, motivating Saeng to retake the test with renewed hope and support.""

Keep up the good work, and continue to refine your writing skills. Your insights are valuable, and with some adjustments, you can express them more effectively.

14,53,"The essay provided has significant room for improvement in terms of clarity, structure, and content. The thesis statement is vague and lacks grammatical accuracy, which makes it difficult to grasp the central idea at first glance. The arguments are underdeveloped, and the sentences are not constructed with the grammatical precision expected. The conclusion simply reiterates the thesis without effectively summarizing the points made, leading to a lack of cohesion in the overall argument. Furthermore, the organization of the essay is fragmented; paragraphs do not flow logically from one to the next, and transitions are either weak or absent. This, combined with simplistic and sometimes incorrect word choices, undermines the intended message. Additionally, the essay contains numerous grammatical errors, including issues with punctuation and sentence structure, which distract the reader and impede readability. To score higher, the writer should focus on crafting a clear and grammatically correct thesis, developing arguments with well-structured and grammatically accurate sentences, and ensuring that the conclusion effectively encapsulates the main ideas. Improving the logical flow between paragraphs and enhancing word choice will also contribute to a more engaging and effective essay.",53,"Your essay presents an attempt to engage with the prompt, but it requires considerable refinement in terms of clarity, structure, and depth. Let's work through these issues systematically.

1. **Clarity and Precision**:
   - Your thesis statement, which suggests that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it ""grabs your attention"" and shows determination, lacks specificity and depth. A thesis should clearly state the main argument and provide a roadmap for the reader.
   - For example, you could refine your thesis to something like: ""The author concludes the story with this paragraph to highlight the protagonist's determination and resilience, symbolizing her readiness to embrace new challenges.""

2. **Development of Ideas**:
   - Your supporting arguments need more elaboration and textual evidence. Simply stating that the paragraph ""grabs your attention"" and ""shows that the girl is determined"" is not enough. Explain how the paragraph achieves these effects and why they are significant.
   - Consider discussing specific elements of the paragraph, such as language, imagery, or symbolism, that contribute to the reader's understanding of the protagonist's determination.

3. **Coherence and Structure**:
   - The essay is quite brief and lacks a clear, logical structure. Develop your argument in a more organized manner, starting with a strong thesis statement, followed by well-supported body paragraphs, and concluding with a summary that ties everything back to your thesis.
   - Use transitions between sentences and paragraphs to improve the flow of your writing. For instance, phrases like ""Furthermore,"" ""Additionally,"" and ""In conclusion,"" can help guide the reader through your arguments.

4. **Language and Vocabulary**:
   - Your language and vocabulary are quite basic. Aim to use varied and precise language to make your essay more engaging and sophisticated.
   - For example, instead of saying ""grabs your attention a little bit,"" you might say, ""captures the reader's attention effectively.""

5. **Grammar and Mechanics**:
   - There are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that need correction. For instance, ""its"" should be ""it's,"" and ""determind"" should be ""determined.""
   - Ensure that your sentences are grammatically accurate and punctuated correctly. Proofreading your work before submission can help catch these errors.

In summary, your essay would benefit from a clearer thesis, more detailed development of ideas, improved coherence, varied vocabulary, and grammatical accuracy. By addressing these areas, you can create a more compelling and precise argument that effectively conveys your insights into the concluding paragraph of the story. Keep up the effort, and don't hesitate to seek further clarification or assistance if needed.","

Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memoreies of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring. This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The concluding paragraph of the essay presents several issues related to clarity, structure, and content. The overall message is somewhat muddled due to confusing syntax and word choice, which detracts from the intended emphasis on the author's memories of her homeland. The paragraph could benefit from more precise language and a clearer connection between the memories evoked by the spring season and the author's decision to retake her driving test. Additionally, the development of the argument lacks coherence, with details about animals and blossoming trees feeling tangential and underdeveloped. The organization is also weak, as transitions between sentences are abrupt, making the narrative hard to follow. Furthermore, grammatical errors such as ""memoreies,"" ""beautifu,"" and several awkward phrasings, impede readability and distract from the content. To improve, the essay should focus on refining sentence structures, ensuring grammatical accuracy, and creating a more logical flow of ideas to effectively convey the emotional significance of the author's memories.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its a very good ending paragraph that grabs your attention a little bit. Also it shows that the girl is determined to pass her test, so that makes you think this is a determind story. This is why the author concluded the story with this paragraph.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay! Here are some specific points of feedback to help you improve:

1. **Clarity and Specificity**: Your essay could benefit from more specific details. For instance, instead of stating that ""it's a very good ending paragraph that grabs your attention,"" explain exactly what makes it attention-grabbing. Is it the suspense, the language, or perhaps the character's resolve?

2. **Sentence Structure**: Try to vary your sentence structure to make your writing more engaging. For example, instead of saying ""Also it shows that the girl is determined to pass her test,"" you might say, ""Additionally, the girl's determination to pass her test is clearly depicted.""

3. **Grammar and Spelling**: Pay attention to grammar and proper word usage. ""Its"" should be ""it's"" (it is), and ""determind"" should be ""determined."" Small errors like these can detract from your overall message.

4. **Depth of Analysis**: Dive deeper into why the ending is effective. Discuss how the author's choice of words, the development of the character, and the story arc contribute to a satisfying conclusion.

5. **Structure and Coherence**: Ensure that each sentence logically follows the previous one and that your paragraph has a clear beginning, middle, and end. This will help your reader follow your argument more easily.

Here’s a revised version incorporating these points:

""The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it effectively captures the reader's attention through its suspenseful tone and the vivid portrayal of the protagonist's determination. The girl's resolve to pass her test is not only a testament to her character but also serves as a powerful conclusion that underscores the theme of perseverance. This deliberate choice by the author ensures that readers are left with a lasting impression of the story's message.""

Keep up the good work, and continue to focus on these areas to further enhance your writing skills!",0.9148329013675869,0.8893426565829516
15,54,"Your essay demonstrates an effort to address the question, but it falls short in several key areas. The thesis, which aims to explain why the author concludes ""Winter Hibiscus"" with a particular paragraph, is not clearly articulated. While you attempt to provide examples from the story, the connections between these examples and the thesis are unclear and underdeveloped. This results in a response that feels somewhat disjointed and unfocused. While your language shows some grasp of grammar and spelling, frequent errors detract from the overall readability and clarity. Moreover, the narrative flow is inconsistent, making it challenging for readers to follow your argument. To improve, ensure that your thesis is explicitly stated and supported with well-chosen, specific examples from the text. Additionally, focus on varying your sentence structures and refining your grammatical accuracy to enhance the overall clarity and impact of your writing.",54,"Your essay attempts to address why the author concluded ""Winter Hibiscus"" with the chosen paragraph, but it struggles with clarity and grammatical precision, which are crucial in conveying your ideas effectively.

Firstly, your thesis statement needs to be clearer. While you mention that the conclusion has a ""touching"" effect and sums up the points discussed in the story, these ideas are not articulated with the precision required for a strong thesis. Consider revising your thesis to explicitly state why the author’s conclusion is impactful and how it ties together the themes of the story.

Your supporting arguments present some interesting observations, but they are hindered by grammatical errors and inconsistent punctuation. For example, in the sentence “In this unique quote, the author demonstrates imagery by giving you a mental picture of a silent lonly girl nealing down in the cold garden, whispering silently to herself,” there are several misspellings (""lonely,"" ""kneeling"") and redundancies (""whispering silently""). Such errors detract from the strength of your analysis. Aim for varied sentence structures and precise language to enhance readability.

The paragraph also lacks smooth transitions between ideas, leading to a somewhat fragmented reading experience. For instance, you jump from discussing imagery to summarizing the story without a clear transition. Using transitional phrases can help guide the reader through your argument more coherently.

Moreover, your conclusion feels rushed and does not effectively summarize your main points or tie them back to the thesis. Instead of simply restating what you previously mentioned, strive to synthesize your arguments, emphasizing how they collectively support your thesis.

To improve, focus on the following:
1. **Clear Thesis**: Clearly state your main argument in the introduction.
2. **Grammatical Precision**: Pay attention to spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure.
3. **Logical Flow**: Use transitions to connect your ideas smoothly.
4. **Varied Vocabulary**: Employ a range of vocabulary to avoid repetition and maintain reader engagement.
5. **Conclusion**: Summarize your main arguments and tie them back to your thesis for a strong finish.

For example, you might revise part of the paragraph to something like this: 

""The concluding paragraph of 'Winter Hibiscus' leaves a lasting impression by encapsulating the story’s central themes and evoking a profound emotional response. The imagery in the phrase 'Saeng vowed silently to herself' vividly portrays a solitary, reflective moment, enhancing the reader’s connection to Saeng's inner journey. Additionally, the author’s reference to the hibiscus and geese effectively ties together key motifs from the story, illustrating Saeng's growth and determination to adapt to her new life.""

By addressing these areas, your essay will become clearer, more precise, and more compelling. Keep up the effort, and continue to refine your writing skills. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask!","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like its going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when shell retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus comes back to life. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good shell feel good

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic attempt to engage with the prompt, but it lacks clarity and depth. The thesis is not clearly stated, making it difficult for readers to understand the main argument. The development of ideas is minimal and somewhat confusing. For example, instead of explaining why the author concluded the story with a statement about a new beginning, the essay drifts into discussing various unrelated aspects. Grammatical errors such as ""about,"" ""is,"" ""desrves,"" and inconsistent verb tenses detract significantly from the readability and flow of the essay. Additionally, the sentence structures are not varied, and the vocabulary is simple and often used incorrectly, leading to a monotonous tone. The paragraph lacks proper transitions, making it disjointed and hard to follow. There is also a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points made, which weakens the overall argument. For future improvement, the writer should focus on crafting a clear thesis, using varied and precise language, and providing specific examples to support their arguments, all while maintaining grammatical accuracy.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the story with  When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better.  A wave of loss so deep and

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a solid effort but struggles with clarity and structure. The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succed, one must keep trying. Saeng will adapt to her new copiuntry in time but not if she spends heer time wishing to go back to her homeland. The hibiscus is a reminder to hers of starting a new and adapting to society. Saeng will retry her drivers test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided lacks clarity and is fraught with grammatical errors, which significantly impede its readability and effectiveness. The thesis statement is somewhat unclear, and the supporting sentences contain numerous mistakes, reducing the impact of the arguments presented. Consequently, the essay does not adequately address the prompt, nor does it remain focused on any coherent argument about Saeng's adaptation to her new country. The sentences are often incomplete or awkwardly structured, further detracting from the essay's overall readability. Additionally, the essay lacks a logical flow, with transitions that are neither smooth nor grammatically correct. The conclusion is abrupt and fails to effectively summarize the thesis, leaving the reader with an incomplete understanding of the author's main points. Improvements in grammatical accuracy, clearer thesis articulation, better organizational structure, and more precise language usage are needed to enhance the quality and coherence of this essay.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: In stories, author lend them many different ways with many different effects. In the story, Winter Hibiscus the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has a touching affect to the reader and it basically sums up all the paints talked about in the story. The first example, is in the beginning of the conclusion, it says Saeng vowed silently to herself. In this unique quote, the author demonstrates imagery by giving you a mental picture of a silent lonly girl nealing down in the cold garden, whispering silently to herself. This quote and this part of the quote has a touching effect to the reader. Another example of why the author concludes the story with this is because it sums up all the parts covered in the story. ""When the geese return hibiscus is budding I will take that test again This quote mentions the hibiscus which is mentioned a lot throughout, the geese in the end, and the failing of the test in the beginning. In conclusion, thats why the author used that paragraph as the conclusion for such a touching story.

FEEDBACK: 
","**FEEDBACK:**

Thank you for your efforts on this essay! You have made a good attempt at analyzing the conclusion of ""Winter Hibiscus"" and its effects on the reader. Here are some areas where you can improve and some suggestions to help you:

1. **Clarity and Structure:**
   - Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Begin with an introductory paragraph that briefly introduces the story and your main argument.
   - Each paragraph should focus on a single point or example that supports your argument. Use topic sentences to make it clear what each paragraph will discuss.

2. **Grammar and Syntax:**
   - Pay attention to your grammar and syntax. For example, ""author lend them many different ways"" should be ""authors end their stories in many different ways.""
   - Make sure each sentence is complete and clear. For instance, ""In the story, Winter Hibiscus the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has a 'touching' affect to the reader and it basically sums up all the paints talked about in the story"" can be improved to: ""In 'Winter Hibiscus,' the author concludes the story with a touching paragraph that effectively sums up the main points discussed throughout.""

3. **Word Choice:**
   - Be careful with word choice. The word ""affect"" should be ""effect"" in this context. Also, ""paints"" should be ""points.""
   - Avoid repetition by finding synonyms and varying your sentence structure.

4. **Evidence and Analysis:**
   - Your essay mentions quotes from the story, which is great. However, each quote should be followed by a more detailed analysis that ties it back to your main argument. Explain why the imagery is unique and how it contributes to the touching effect.
   - Make sure to provide a bit more context for each quote to help the reader understand its significance within the story.

5. **Polish and Proofread:**
   - Always proofread your work for spelling errors and typos. For example, ""lonly"" should be ""lonely,"" and ""nealing"" should be ""kneeling.""
   - Consider reading your essay out loud to catch any errors or awkward phrasing.

Here is a revised version of your first paragraph to illustrate some of these points:

---

**Revised Paragraph:**

In literature, authors conclude their stories in various ways to invoke different effects on the reader. In ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author ends the story with a poignant paragraph that deeply touches the reader and encapsulates the central themes of the narrative. For example, the phrase ""Saeng vowed silently to herself"" creates a vivid image of a lonely girl kneeling in the cold garden, whispering her resolve. This imagery provides a powerful emotional connection for the reader. Furthermore, the line ""When the geese return and hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" ties together key elements from the story: the hibiscus mentioned throughout, the ge",0.9541581970759343,0.9234624488736751
16,56,"The essay demonstrates a heartfelt and engaging narrative, providing a vivid portrayal of the challenges and joys of immigrant life. The author effectively conveys the cultural richness and familial bonds in their upbringing, using specific examples from the memoir to support their points. However, the essay sometimes lacks clarity in connecting back to a clear thesis statement, making it difficult to fully grasp the central argument. While the content is interesting and flows smoothly, occasional grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures detract from its overall clarity and polish. The language is generally good, with a varied vocabulary that enhances the narrative, but there are instances where word choice could be more precise. Overall, the essay offers a meaningful reflection on the importance of family and cultural heritage, yet it could be strengthened by a more defined thesis and attention to grammatical precision.",56,"Your essay successfully captures the essence of the memoir, emphasizing the themes of contentment and happiness within the context of Narciso's Cuban home. The vivid description of cultural elements like music, traditional cooking, and family ambiance offers a compelling portrayal of the author's experiences. However, there are several areas that require attention to improve clarity, structure, and grammatical accuracy.

First, let's address the thesis statement in your opening sentence. While it introduces the challenges of living away from one's home country, it is somewhat vague and could be more precise. Consider specifying how the memoir demonstrates the contrasting elements of difficulty and happiness.

For example:
""Living away from one's home country can present significant challenges, including poverty and discrimination, yet Narciso Rodriguez's memoir beautifully illustrates how contentment and cultural richness can flourish despite these adversities.""

Next, your sentences occasionally lack grammatical precision and coherence, which can confuse the reader. For instance, ""Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally"" is awkwardly phrased. It would be clearer to write:
""Poverty often dominates the situation, accompanied by occasional racism and discrimination.""

Moreover, the transition between the first and second sentences could be smoother to ensure a logical flow of ideas. Additionally, phrases like ""lightens up"" should be replaced with more precise language to maintain an academic tone. Consider rephrasing it to:
""This quote illuminates the memoir's central theme, illustrating how people from various backgrounds came together to celebrate life's joys despite facing societal challenges.""

Your vocabulary choice is generally good, but there are instances of repetitive language and simplistic word choices. Try to diversify your vocabulary to make the essay more engaging. For example, instead of ""best of all ambiance of family being around,"" you could write ""most notably, the warm and inviting ambiance created by the presence of family.""

Finally, there are a few punctuation errors and sentence structure issues. Ensure that all sentences are complete and avoid run-ons. For example:
""In the home, he still got to experience Cuban culture including music, traditional cooking and best of all ambiance of family being around.""
Could be improved to:
""In his home, Narciso continued to experience Cuban culture, including music, traditional cooking, and, most importantly, the warm ambiance created by his family.""

In summary, your essay provides a heartfelt and vivid account of the memoir, but it would benefit greatly from a more precise thesis statement, improved sentence structure, varied vocabulary, and careful attention to grammatical accuracy. Keep up the good work, and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions as you revise.","

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a heartfelt and detailed account of the author's upbringing in a traditional Cuban home. The narrative effectively evokes a warm and comforting mood, supported by specific examples from the memoir. However, there are several grammatical errors and inconsistencies that detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. For instance, the use of ""@CAPS1"" appears to be a placeholder or redaction, which disrupts the flow of the text and makes it difficult to follow. Additionally, there are punctuation issues, such as the use of ampersands (&) instead of ""and,"" and some sentences are overly complex or improperly structured. The organization of the essay is mostly clear, with logical progression from one idea to the next, but some transitions could be smoother. The vocabulary is somewhat varied, though there are instances of repetition and incorrect usage. Overall, while the essay is interesting and provides a vivid portrayal of the author's family life, it would benefit greatly from a thorough review to correct grammatical errors and improve sentence structure.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay in question demonstrates a clear effort to convey the memoir's themes of friendship and family. However, it falls short in several key areas. The thesis statement is somewhat unclear and lacks grammatical accuracy. The arguments are presented, but they lack depth and sufficient development, making the supporting evidence seem superficial. Additionally, the sentences are grammatically correct but often simplistic and repetitive, leading to a lack of complexity and variation in word choice and sentence structure. The organization of the essay is weak, with transitions and topic sentences that do not effectively guide the reader through the argument. Furthermore, there are noticeable errors in spelling and punctuation, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. To improve, the writer should focus on crafting a clear and grammatically correct thesis statement, developing arguments with greater depth and precision, and ensuring that transitions and topic sentences are logically structured and grammatically accurate. Enhanced vocabulary and varied sentence structures would also contribute to a more engaging and effective essay.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Living life in a country or place away can be very difficult from what I've known, heard and seen. Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally. Nonetheless, this well-told memoir tells of the contentment and good side of it all. The happiness that was created in a place that Narciso calls home. In the home, he still got to experience Cuban culture including music, traditional cooking and best of all ambiance of family being around. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote kind of lightens up the whole idea of this memoir and how people from all over came together to celebrate the wonderful joys of life even though at times they were frowned upon.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Dear [Student's Name],

Thank you for sharing your essay with me. You have touched upon some important themes and presented a thoughtful reflection on Narciso's experiences. Here are a few points of feedback based on the values I hold dear in writing:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: Your essay introduces some complex ideas, but at times it can be challenging to follow your line of thought. Try to ensure that each sentence clearly connects to the next. For instance, you might want to elaborate more on how poverty, racism, and discrimination are juxtaposed with the happiness and contentment Narciso finds in his home.

2. **Specificity and Detail**: Providing specific examples can make your essay more vivid and engaging. You mention Cuban culture, music, and traditional cooking—consider adding a few more details or anecdotes to bring these elements to life for the reader.

3. **Grammar and Syntax**: Pay attention to sentence structure and grammar. For example, the first sentence reads, ""Living life in a country or place away can be very difficult from what I've known, heard and seen."" This could be clearer if rephrased to something like, ""Living in a different country can be very challenging, as I’ve come to understand from various accounts."" Also, be mindful of subject-verb agreement and punctuation throughout your essay.

4. **Quotation Integration**: You included a powerful quote, which is great, but try to integrate it more smoothly into your essay. Explain its significance and how it ties into your overall argument. You might say, ""This quote illuminates the core of Narciso's memoir, highlighting how the warmth of family and cultural traditions can create a sense of home and joy, even in the face of external challenges.""

5. **Conclusion and Reflection**: Your essay would benefit from a stronger conclusion that ties together your main points and offers a final reflection on why Narciso’s story is significant. What can readers learn from his experience? How does it resonate with broader themes of resilience and cultural identity?

Overall, your essay has a strong foundation, and with some refinement, it can become even more impactful. Keep up the good work, and continue to think deeply about the themes you wish to explore.

17,57,"The essay effectively captures the mood created by the author and provides specific evidence from the memoir to support the statements made. It clearly articulates the emotions of happiness, curiosity, and sadness elicited by the narrative. However, the response occasionally deviates from the focus, such as when it wonders about the reasons behind the parents' actions, which slightly detracts from the main analysis. The grammar and spelling have several errors, including incorrect capitalization and punctuation, which interrupt the flow of the essay and reduce its overall clarity. Additionally, the vocabulary is somewhat limited and repetitive, lacking the variation necessary for a higher level of sophistication. Transitions between ideas are present but are not always smooth, making parts of the narrative feel disjointed. Overall, the essay demonstrates an understanding of the memoir, but it could benefit from more precise language use, better organization, and a stronger adherence to the central question.",57,"Your essay demonstrates a genuine engagement with the memoir and effectively conveys a range of emotions experienced by the author. However, there are several areas that need improvement to enhance clarity, grammatical accuracy, and overall coherence.

1. **Thesis Statement and Structure**: 
   - Your opening thesis statement is somewhat unclear. For instance, ""The author creates a very happy, but curious mood towards the reader"" can be rephrased for better precision. Consider something like, ""The author evokes a complex mood, blending happiness with curiosity and sadness, to illustrate the profound sacrifices made by Narciso's parents.""

2. **Supporting Arguments and Evidence**: 
   - While you provide examples from the text, your arguments can be better developed. For example, after quoting ""start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find,"" you might delve deeper into the significance of this struggle and how it shapes the overall mood of the memoir.
   - Avoid vague references like ""@LOCATION1"" and ""@MONTH1."" Specify actual details to strengthen your argument.

3. **Grammar and Punctuation**: 
   - There are several grammatical errors that need addressing. For example, ""Narciso mom"" should be ""Narciso's mom,"" and ""Studied"" should be ""studied."" Ensure proper noun capitalization and possessive forms are correctly used.
   - Punctuation needs attention, particularly around quotations. For example, ""Back in Cuba, 'Narciso, Sr., had worked...'"" should be better integrated into your sentence structure.

4. **Sentence Structure and Clarity**: 
   - Some sentences are overly complex and would benefit from simplification and clearer structure. For example, ""The reading made me happy for Narciso, but curious on how much his parents had to struggle to give Narciso the best life he could get"" could be refined to: ""The memoir made me happy for Narciso but also curious about the extent of his parents' struggles to provide him with a better life.""

5. **Emotional Impact**: 
   - You effectively convey the emotional impact of the memoir, but ensure your expressions are precise and grammatically correct. For instance, ""This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again"" could be improved to: ""This evoked sadness as it highlights the heart-wrenching decision many immigrants face, leaving behind parents, friends, and the possibility of never seeing them again.""

6. **Vocabulary and Word Choice**: 
   - Aim for varied and accurate vocabulary. Repetitive phrases such as ""made me"" can be replaced with more descriptive language to better articulate your reactions.

**Summary and Suggestions for Improvement**:
- Refine your thesis statement for clarity and grammatical accuracy.
- Develop your supporting arguments with more depth and detailed evidence from the text.
- Address grammatical errors, particularly in punctuation and possessive forms.

Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", tells us of how @CAPS1 grew up with his parents who which immigrated from Cuba, the mood created by the author is warm & comforting.For example, the mood is comforting because, @CAPS1 speaks of how, his parents created a traditional Cuban home, out of nothing but a one bedroom apartment. @CAPS1 descrbes his life being centered around the kitchen & his parent always provideing what they could the best for him.""@CAPS1 also states ""I will always be grateful to my

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a heartfelt and detailed account of the author's upbringing in a traditional Cuban home. The narrative effectively evokes a warm and comforting mood, supported by specific examples from the memoir. However, there are several grammatical errors and inconsistencies that detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. For instance, the use of ""@CAPS1"" appears to be a placeholder or redaction, which disrupts the flow of the text and makes it difficult to follow. Additionally, there are punctuation issues, such as the use of ampersands (&) instead of ""and,"" and some sentences are overly complex or improperly structured. The organization of the essay is mostly clear, with logical progression from one idea to the next, but some transitions could be smoother. The vocabulary is somewhat varied, though there are instances of repetition and incorrect usage. Overall, while the essay is interesting and provides a vivid portrayal of the author's family life, it would benefit greatly from a thorough review to correct grammatical errors and improve sentence structure.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created in this memoir is friendship. One reason is because his parents let the door open for the peope they considered family. A quote that shows this is ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors to the many people we consider family. This shows that the mood is friendship because his parents are great friends to their family.        A second reason is the importance of friend ship. A quote that shows this is ""the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay in question demonstrates a clear effort to convey the memoir's themes of friendship and family. However, it falls short in several key areas. The thesis statement is somewhat unclear and lacks grammatical accuracy. The arguments are presented, but they lack depth and sufficient development, making the supporting evidence seem superficial. Additionally, the sentences are grammatically correct but often simplistic and repetitive, leading to a lack of complexity and variation in word choice and sentence structure. The organization of the essay is weak, with transitions and topic sentences that do not effectively guide the reader through the argument. Furthermore, there are noticeable errors in spelling and punctuation, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. To improve, the writer should focus on crafting a clear and grammatically correct thesis statement, developing arguments with greater depth and precision, and ensuring that transitions and topic sentences are logically structured and grammatically accurate. Enhanced vocabulary and varied sentence structures would also contribute to a more engaging and effective essay.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the story with  When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again For many good reasons.

She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better.  A wave of loss so deep and

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a solid effort but struggles with clarity and structure. The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.



---------------------------

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author creates a very happy, but curious mood towards the reader. The reading made me happy for Narciso, but curious on how much his parents had to struggle to give Narciso the best life he could get. For example the author states that his parents had to ""start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find."" Back in Cuba, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso mom) had Studied chemical engineering."" This shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to @LOCATION1. This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved."" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again. The author creates a variety of different moods throught the memoir.

**Feedback:**

Dear [Student's Name],

Thank you for your thoughtful essay on the author's depiction of emotions and the struggles faced by Narciso's family. You did a commendable job of identifying the different moods created by the author and how they impacted you as a reader. Here are some specific points to consider:

1. **Mood Analysis:**
   - You have effectively highlighted the happy and curious mood created by the author's descriptions. Your understanding of how the family's sacrifices evoked these feelings is clear and insightful.

2. **Textual Evidence:**
   - You've included relevant quotations to support your points, which is excellent. However, remember to format your quotes correctly and provide proper citations if this is a requirement for your assignment.

3. **Clarity and Detail:**
   - Your essay could benefit from more detailed analysis. For example, you mention feeling curious about the parents' struggles but don't delve deeply into what specific challenges they might have faced or how this curiosity enhances the narrative.

4. **Emotion and Personal Reflection:**
   - You've done well in reflecting on how the text made you feel, particularly with the sadness evoked by the immigrants' sacrifices. Personal reflections like these add depth to your analysis.

5. **Grammar and Conventions:**
   - There are a few grammatical errors and typos that need attention. For instance, ""Narciso mom"" should be ""Narciso's mom,"" and ""throught"" should be ""throughout."" Be sure to proofread your work to catch these errors.
   - Additionally, placeholders like ""@LOCATION1"" and ""@MONTH1"" should be replaced with specific details to maintain coherence.

6. **Structure and Coherence:**
   - Your essay has a good structure, but try to ensure each paragraph flows logically into the next. Transition sentences can help connect your ideas more smoothly.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - While you hinted at the variety of moods created in the memoir, summarizing these points more explicitly in your conclusion would strengthen your essay.

Overall, you've made a strong start! Paying attention to these details will enhance the clarity and impact of your writing. Keep up the good work, and continue to explore and express your insights with confidence.

18,65,"The essay provides a clear main thesis that argues the benefits of using computers, supported by practical examples. However, the development of the arguments is somewhat simplistic and could benefit from more detailed and varied evidence. The structure is fairly organized with a basic introduction, body, and conclusion, but the transitions between ideas are not always smooth, and some points feel repetitive. The word choice is functional but lacks variety and precision, which makes the writing less engaging. Sentence structure is mostly straightforward, though occasionally mechanical, which impacts the overall flow of the essay. The essay demonstrates a good grasp of standard writing conventions, with minimal errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, contributing to its readability. Overall, while the essay is clear and practical, it could be improved by adding more depth to the arguments, enhancing the transitions, and using a more sophisticated vocabulary and varied sentence structures.",65,"Dear @PERSON1,

Thank you for sharing your essay. It’s clear that you are enthusiastic about the topic and have put thought into explaining how computers benefit people. To help you further develop your writing skills and make your argument more compelling, I'd like to offer some feedback.

**Thesis and Clarity:**
Your essay presents a clear thesis that computers benefit people, but it could be more focused. Instead of saying ""I benefit people using computers,"" which could be confusing, try rephrasing to something like, ""Computers benefit people by teaching hand-eye coordination, enabling communication, and providing access to information.""

**Support and Examples:**
You have provided several examples to support your points, which is excellent. However, these examples would be more effective if they included specific, real-world details. For instance, when you mention learning about new places and people, you could refer to a specific website or program that helped you gain this knowledge. Concrete examples add credibility to your arguments.

**Organization and Flow:**
Your essay is organized into an introduction, body, and conclusion, but the flow between ideas needs improvement. To enhance readability, consider using clear topic sentences for each paragraph and smoother transitions. For example:
- ""First, computers teach hand-eye coordination. For instance, when I use educational games on the computer, I improve my coordination skills while learning.""
- ""Secondly, computers allow communication with others. For example, using Facebook enables me to stay in touch with friends and family.""
- ""Lastly, computers provide access to vast amounts of information, which is essential for school projects. For instance, using online databases helps me gather information about historical events.""

**Language and Precision:**
Your word choice is sometimes imprecise and repetitive. Aim for varied and specific language to keep the reader engaged. Instead of saying ""it always gives me the ability to learn about new places and people,"" you could say, ""it enables me to explore diverse cultures and geographies.""

**Grammar and Conventions:**
There are several grammatical errors and awkward sentences that need refinement. For example, ""alot"" should be ""a lot,"" and ""learn about learn about"" is repetitive. Pay close attention to punctuation, capitalization, and spelling. Proofreading your essay or using tools like spell check can help catch these mistakes.

**Conclusion:**
Your conclusion summarizes the key points well but could be stronger by reiterating the importance of these benefits in a concise manner. For example: ""In conclusion, computers are invaluable tools that enhance hand-eye coordination, enable global communication, and provide essential information for educational purposes. These benefits underscore the profound impact of computers on our daily lives.""

Overall, you’ve demonstrated a good understanding of how computers benefit people. With more precise language, specific examples, and improved organization, your essay will be more persuasive and effective. Keep working on these areas, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you need further clarification.

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear editor, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I believe that computers are a benefit to the world, and people as well. I say this because lots of people can talk to family of friends long distance. Also the computer can teach you lots of thing. Finally it makes you more social. In @CAPS1 strong opinion computers are better for the world. Firstly, many people can talk long distance with family of friends. You have web cam and that allows you to chat and see the person. Also @CAPS2 is another site

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and relevant thesis statement regarding the benefits of computers, and the main ideas are adequately supported with examples. However, the arguments could benefit from more specific real-world examples and pragmatic reasoning to strengthen the claims. The essay is organized with an introduction, body, and conclusion, but the transitions between paragraphs and the overall flow could be improved for a smoother reading experience. The word choice is mostly effective, conveying the intended message clearly, although some phrases lack precision and could be refined for better clarity. The sentence structures are varied but could be more fluid to enhance readability. There are minimal errors in conventions, but attention to correct usage of punctuation, spelling, and capitalization would improve the overall quality. Overall, the essay is clear and focused, but it could be enhanced with better organization, more precise language, and stronger examples to fully meet the teacher's expectations for clarity, practicality, and linguistic precision.

Computers in many countres are standard and we use then to learn many things but if you bring one to the tribes in @LOCATION1 it will look like a alein object but once they know how to use it it can open there eyes for ever

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay you presented demonstrates a genuine enthusiasm for the topic of the benefits of owning a computer, but it requires significant refinement in several areas to meet higher standards. The content is somewhat clear and addresses the prompt, though the examples provided are often broad and lack depth in real-world relevance. Incorporating more specific, illustrative examples would enhance the argument's effectiveness. The organization of the essay is somewhat disjointed, with ideas jumping from one to another without clear transitions or a logical flow. Improving the structure by using well-defined topic sentences and coherent transitions between paragraphs would help. 

In terms of word choice, the essay frequently uses casual and imprecise language, which detracts from its persuasive power. Employing a more formal and precise vocabulary would improve readability and impact. Sentence fluency is also an issue; many sentences are awkwardly constructed and run-on, making the essay difficult to follow at times. Simplifying sentence structures and varying them would help create a smoother reading experience. Finally, conventions are a major area for improvement. The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, incorrect spelling, and improper punctuation, all of which impede readability and distract from the argument. A thorough proofreading to correct these mistakes is essential. Overall, while the essay shows promise in engaging with the topic, it needs significant work in clarity, structure, language precision, and grammatical accuracy to fully persuade the reader.

Many people love computers. It is one of the most best inventions to everyone around the world. They teach positive things for people to learn. Computer even have a positive effect on people across

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear stance on the positive effects of computers but lacks depth and specificity in its arguments. The thesis is somewhat ambiguous and repetitive, which diminishes its overall clarity and impact. There is an attempt to develop and support the thesis, but the examples provided are general and unconvincing. For instance, the discussion on hand-eye coordination is not thoroughly explained or supported with concrete evidence. The organization of the essay is basic, with a discernible introduction, body, and conclusion; however, the flow of ideas is somewhat disjointed and lacks smooth transitions. The language used is simplistic and at times redundant, which affects the precision and engagement of the writing. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors and awkward sentence constructions that impede readability. To strengthen the essay, it would benefit from a more precise thesis, richer and more specific examples, improved coherence, and careful attention to language and stylistic choices. Overall, the essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the topic but requires significant refinement to meet the teacher's expectations for clarity, practicality, and precision.

FEEDBACK: 
","Dear [Student's Name],

Thank you for your essay submission. I can see that you have put effort into expressing your thoughts on how computers benefit people, and I appreciate your enthusiasm about the subject. Here are some constructive points to help improve your writing:

1. **Structure and Organization**:
   - Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Consider breaking it into distinct paragraphs for each of your reasons. Start with an introduction, followed by separate paragraphs for each reason, and end with a conclusion.
   - Ensure each paragraph starts with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea of that paragraph.

2. **Clarity and Specificity**:
   - Instead of using placeholders like @CAPS1, @NUM1, @ORGANIZATION1, etc., use specific names, places, and numbers. This will make your essay more personal and easier to understand.
   - Be specific about the sources you mention. For example, name the TV channel or website you refer to, and provide accurate statistics if possible.

3. **Grammar and Punctuation**:
   - Pay attention to grammar and punctuation to make your writing clearer. For example, ""In my opinion, I benefit people using computers"" should include a comma.
   - Avoid run-on sentences. Break long sentences into shorter, more manageable ones.
   - Ensure subject-verb agreement. For example, ""they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability…” should be ""they teach hand-eye coordination and give people the ability…""

4. **Examples and Evidence**:
   - Provide clear and relevant examples to support your points. For instance, instead of saying ""for example, when I am always using the computer…,"" specify a particular instance or project where the computer helped you.

5. **Coherence and Flow**:
   - Ensure your essay flows smoothly from one point to the next. Transitional phrases can help guide the reader through your argument.
   - Reiterate your main points in the conclusion to reinforce your argument, but avoid simply repeating the same phrases.

6. **Tone and Persuasiveness**:
   - While it’s good to be confident, stating ""I am a really smart kid"" might come across as boastful. Focus on presenting your points clearly and let the reader conclude your intelligence from the quality of your writing.
   - Make your conclusion compelling. Instead of saying ""please try to make this believable,"" summarize why your points are strong and well-supported.

Here’s a revised version of your introduction to serve as an example:

---

Dear Local Newspaper,

My name is [Your Name]. I am [Your Age] years old and I attend [Your School Name] in [Your Location]. I believe that I benefit people by using computers, and I would like to share with you three compelling reasons why. Firstly, computers enhance hand-eye coordination and provide opportunities to learn about distant places and people. Secondly, they enable communication with others online. Lastly, they are invaluable tools for students",0.9028135102321194,0.9067237654738104
19,67,"The essay presents a clear and relevant thesis, emphasizing the balance between personal rights and the protection of youth in the context of censorship. The arguments are well-developed, supported with historical references and hypothetical scenarios that effectively illustrate the potential consequences of censorship. However, the essay would benefit from stronger real-world examples to enhance its persuasiveness. The organization is logical, with coherent transitions and well-defined topic sentences that guide the reader through the argument. The language and style are practical and appropriate, using suitable vocabulary and straightforward sentence structures that convey the intended message effectively. There is a smooth flow to the writing, although occasional awkward constructions could be refined for better readability. The essay demonstrates control over standard writing conventions, though minor errors in spelling and grammar are present and should be corrected to improve the overall quality. Overall, the essay is clear, practical, and relevant, aligning well with the teacher's values of clarity, practicality, real-world relevance, and linguistic precision.",67,"Your essay on censorship presents a compelling argument but requires more clarity and organization to fully articulate your points. Here are some areas for improvement:

1. **Clear Thesis Statement:**
   - Your thesis is somewhat buried in the text. Try to state it more explicitly in the introduction to guide the reader from the beginning. For example, ""Censorship is generally unacceptable because it infringes on personal rights and has historically led to oppression, except when used to protect children.""

2. **Logical Organization:**
   - Your essay would benefit from clearer organization. Each paragraph should begin with a strong topic sentence that outlines the main idea. For example, your second paragraph could start with, ""Censorship in public libraries undermines the fundamental right to access diverse literature.""

3. **Practical Language and Real-World Examples:**
   - You have a good start with your hypothetical public library example, but it could be more detailed. Perhaps compare a real-world instance where censorship led to a significant loss of literary freedom, such as the banning of certain books in historical contexts.
   - Similarly, when discussing dictators, mentioning specific events or figures (e.g., Nazi Germany’s book burnings) would add weight to your argument.

4. **Transitions and Coherence:**
   - Your ideas need smoother transitions. For example, the shift from the discussion on public libraries to historical dictatorships is quite abrupt. Use transitional phrases to guide the reader through your arguments seamlessly.

5. **Word Choice and Grammar:**
   - Pay attention to spelling and word choice. For instance, ""ceratin"" should be ""certain,"" and ""perrogative"" should be ""prerogative.""
   - Ensure you use formal language throughout. Words like ""risque"" should be replaced with ""inappropriate"" or ""explicit"" to maintain a professional tone.

6. **Depth and Specificity:**
   - While your argument about protecting children is valid, it needs more depth. Explain why protecting children is not considered censorship and provide examples of effective age-appropriate guidelines.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Your conclusion should reiterate your main points clearly and concisely. Summarize why censorship is generally harmful and restate the exception for protecting the youth with a strong closing statement.

**Revised Example:**

""Does censorship solve any problems? Generally, censorship infringes on personal rights and has historically led to oppression, except when used to protect children. As a free country, it is every individual's right to access literature and music of their choice. History has shown that censorship leads to tyranny, and thus it should be avoided, except when safeguarding young minds. 

Public libraries are meant to be places of learning and enjoyment for people of all backgrounds. If books are removed due to subjective disapproval, it undermines this purpose. For example, in the past, books like 'To Kill a Mockingbird' have been banned for various reasons, yet they offer valuable lessons that","

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay you provided needs substantial improvement in several areas to meet the guidelines outlined by the teacher. The content of the essay is somewhat unclear and minimally developed; the arguments presented are not well-supported with real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning, making it difficult to understand the main points. The organization of the essay is weak, with ideas presented in a fragmented and disjointed manner. The lack of coherent transitions between sentences and paragraphs further disrupts the flow of the essay, making it hard for the reader to follow the argument. Word choice is poor, with numerous spelling errors and inappropriate vocabulary that detracts from the overall message. Sentence fluency is also lacking, with awkward constructions and repetitive phrasing that impede readability. Additionally, there are frequent grammatical errors, incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization issues that significantly distract the reader. To improve, the essay should focus on presenting a clear and relevant thesis statement, developing well-supported arguments with practical examples, and concluding effectively. Enhancing the organization with clear topic sentences and transitions, using appropriate and precise vocabulary, and adhering to standard writing conventions will also contribute to a higher quality essay.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay you provided needs substantial improvement in several areas to meet the guidelines outlined by the teacher. The content of the essay is somewhat unclear and minimally developed; the arguments presented are not well-supported with real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning, making it difficult to understand the main points. The organization of the essay is weak, with ideas presented in a fragmented and disjointed manner. The lack of coherent transitions between sentences and paragraphs further disrupts the flow of the essay, making it hard for the reader to follow the argument. Word choice is poor, with numerous spelling errors and inappropriate vocabulary that detracts from the overall message. Sentence fluency is also lacking, with awkward constructions and repetitive phrasing that impede readability. Additionally, there are frequent grammatical errors, incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization issues that significantly distract the reader. To improve, the essay should focus on presenting a clear and relevant thesis statement, developing well-supported arguments with practical examples, and concluding effectively. Enhancing the organization with clear topic sentences and transitions, using appropriate and precise vocabulary, and adhering to standard writing conventions will also contribute to a higher quality essay.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: There should not be a certain kinds of books in the library. Books should not be tooken off the shelf just because some people find them offensive. Do not get the book, other people might like it, its just for entertainment.     If you do not like the book do not have to get the book. While looking for a book if there is one that does not seem right just look past. It will not even be a bother. There is a lot of books in the library, just find a different book instead of just focusing on that

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to address the topic of censorship in libraries; however, it lacks clarity and depth in its arguments. The main ideas are overly broad and repetitive, failing to engage the reader or provide strong support for the thesis. The essay's organization is weak, with a loose structure that lacks clear transitions and well-defined topic sentences, making it challenging to follow the author's train of thought. The word choice is often inappropriate and imprecise, using informal and incorrect terms such as ""tooken."" The sentence fluency is mechanical, with awkward constructions that impede readability. Furthermore, the essay contains several grammatical errors, including incorrect verb tense and punctuation issues, which detract from its overall effectiveness. To improve, the author should focus on developing a clear, concise thesis and supporting it with relevant, well-organized arguments and real-world examples. Additionally, attention should be given to refining sentence structure and word choice, as well as proofreading for grammatical accuracy.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Does censorship solve any problems?  If one person wants to censor something in a library, there is bound to be another person on the other side of that arguement  trying to protect that work from be taken away.  As a free country, it is every individuals right to take in whatever form of literature or music that they find pleasing, and history has shown the world that censorship leads those in power down a dark road.  The shielding of offensive materials is only necessary and fair when the young, impressionable minds of the world's youth are at stake, but once a person is old enough to make informed decisions, it should be their perrogative to choose their own material.  Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history, but necessary when protecting the young.     It is a person's right to choose what kind of literature they would like to read.  If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned.  For example take a hypothetical public library: a public library is an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music.  A great mental image of serenity and peace.  How does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves?  Suddenly right and left, books are disappearing as if by magic: a ceratin book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad.  Before long, there are not very many books left in this hypothetical library other than books for toddlers.  With this system, everyone suffers.  Everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to.  It would all just be simpler if book were just not banned from libraries.     History has given the world many a cruel dictator.  Oftentimes, once he comes to power, he is not the most popular of governmental forms.  To keep his subjects underneath his rule, often he has to resort to taking away civil rights.  This could be a curfew, fake elections, or censorship.  If the ruler has the power of censorship, he or she can control what the public thinks, feels, and believes.  With this power over them, the people are weakened and often abused.  Now imagine that censorship occuring in a country that has civil rights.  People would not stand for it.  So why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom?  There is absolutely no need for censorship to occur, and as history has shown, it certainly is not a good thing.     Censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights.  There is, however, one other element at play here: protection of youth and innocence.  Almost everyone can remember a time a child when they were young and innocent, free of worry and trouble.  That can disappear in a instant.  Children should not be exposed to things that are innappropriate for their age.  Nearly every movie nowadays has violent and risque, if not full-blown-adult, materials present in it.  The age of innocence is getting younger every generation, and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point.  A claim like this @MONTH1 sound hypotcritical coming from the mouth of one against censorship, but it is not 'censorship' when one is protecting the young.      Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children.  It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon.  The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people.  Also, children should be protected, and that is not censorship.  Censorship solves no problems, but it makes everyone unhappy.  Therefore, why censor

FEEDBACK: 
","**Feedback:**

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Stance**: Your essay has a clear stance on the issue of censorship. You effectively argue against censorship while acknowledging the need to protect young, impressionable minds.
2. **Historical Context**: You provide historical context and examples to support your argument, which strengthens your position.
3. **Imagery and Examples**: The use of a hypothetical public library to illustrate your point is effective. It helps the reader visualize the consequences of censorship.
4. **Structure**: Your essay has a logical structure, with distinct sections for different points of your argument.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Spelling and Grammar**: There are several spelling and grammatical errors that need to be addressed. For example, ""arguement"" should be ""argument,"" ""perrogative"" should be ""prerogative,"" and ""ceratin"" should be ""certain.""
2. **Clarity and Conciseness**: Some sentences are a bit long and convoluted. Try to break them down into shorter, clearer sentences. For instance, ""If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned"" could be simplified for clarity.
3. **Consistency**: Ensure that your argument is consistent throughout. At times, the essay seems to waver, particularly in the section about protecting children. Clarify that while you oppose censorship for adults, you support age-appropriate restrictions for children.
4. **Transition and Flow**: Improve the transitions between paragraphs to ensure a smoother flow of ideas. Currently, some sections feel disjointed.
5. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion should be more definitive and concise. It currently feels a bit repetitive. Summarize your main points clearly and end with a strong statement.
6. **Error in Placeholder**: There is a placeholder ""@MONTH1"" that seems out of place and needs correction.

**Specific Suggestions:**
1. **Introduction**: Start with a more engaging hook to capture the reader's attention.
2. **Examples**: While your historical context is valuable, you could also include recent examples to make your argument more relatable to contemporary readers.
3. **Balancing Act**: While you argue against censorship, ensure you also emphasize the importance of diverse viewpoints and intellectual freedom.

**Revised Excerpt for Clarity:**
""Imagine a hypothetical public library: an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music. This serene image is shattered once books begin disappearing from the shelves. If a book is disapproved of by certain groups, it might be removed, leading to a slippery slope where eventually, very few books remain. In such a system, everyone suffers.

20,70,"The essay demonstrates a minimal attempt at addressing the prompt, with several areas requiring significant improvement. The thesis and main ideas lack clarity and coherence, making it difficult for the reader to grasp the writer's central argument. The essay's content is underdeveloped, with few specific examples from Joe Kurmaskie's essay to support the points made. The language and spelling exhibit numerous errors, including incorrect word choices and grammatical mistakes, which detract from the overall readability and impact. Organizationally, the essay is disjointed, lacking clear transitions and well-defined topic sentences, resulting in a fragmented flow of ideas. The essay could benefit from a thorough revision to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall effectiveness, ensuring that it adheres more closely to the prompt and includes well-supported, relevant examples from the memoir.",70,"The essay begins with a relevant focus on how specific features of the setting affected the cyclist, which is a good start. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance clarity, depth, and cohesion.

1. **Clarity and Practicality**: Your initial sentence is somewhat vague. Consider specifying which features you will discuss. For example, ""Certain features of the desert setting, such as the ghost town and the lack of water, significantly affected the cyclist.""

2. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis is implied rather than clearly stated. Try to formulate a concise thesis that encapsulates your main points. For instance, ""In Joe Kurmaskie's essay, the harsh desert conditions and ghost towns profoundly challenge the cyclist, both physically and mentally.""

3. **Supporting Details**: While you reference specific parts of the essay, your supporting details need more development and specificity. Describe how these elements affected the cyclist's journey in more detail. For example, explain how the ""ghost town"" and ""lack of water"" specifically impacted him.

4. **Real-World Examples**: Utilize more real-world examples or practical analogies to strengthen your arguments. Relate Kurmaskie's experiences to more general examples of how harsh environments can affect travelers. This will add depth to your analysis.

5. **Organization and Transitions**: Your transitions between ideas are abrupt, making the essay harder to follow. Use transitional phrases to connect your points logically. For example, ""Initially amused by the ghost town's eerie charm, the cyclist soon finds these same elements to be sources of hardship.""

6. **Grammar and Word Choice**: There are several grammatical errors and misspellings that distract from the readability of your essay. Pay close attention to spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. For example, ""desribes"" should be ""describes,"" ""difinition"" should be ""definition,"" and ""skeletle"" should be ""skeptical."" A thorough proofreading can help catch these errors.

7. **Conclusions and Implications**: Your conclusion should reinforce your thesis and provide practical implications. Summarize how the setting's features affected the cyclist and what this might suggest about dealing with similar challenges in real life.

Here is a revised version of your initial passage for reference:

""Certain features of the desert setting, such as the ghost town and the lack of water, significantly affected the cyclist. In Joe Kurmaskie’s essay, he describes his experiences cycling through a desert: '...arrived at the first town...it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.' Initially amused and perhaps skeptical because the old 'codgers' claimed it was once thriving, the cyclist soon faces the harsh reality: 'sometimes life can be so cruel.' As his water supply dwindles and the park remains distant, he feels overwhelmed by the endless hills of nothingness under the scorching sun. The ghost town and lack of shade or water are crucial features that make the cyclist regret taking","

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Rolling hills, open terran, hgh deserts-all are features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic response to the prompt by discussing how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, focusing on rolling hills, open terrain, and high deserts. However, it lacks depth and specificity in its supporting details, which limits the clarity and persuasiveness of the arguments. The writer uses some real-world examples but does not fully develop them to support their points effectively. The narrative follows a logical sequence, but transitions between ideas are somewhat abrupt, making the flow less smooth. While the language is generally clear and functional, it shows occasional errors in spelling and grammar, such as ""terran,"" ""hgh,"" and ""mles,"" which detract from the overall readability. Improving the essay would involve elaborating on the points with more detailed and specific examples, enhancing the transitions between ideas for better coherence, and carefully proofreading to correct grammatical errors.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay lacks clarity and practical relevance, making it difficult for the reader to follow the main points. The thesis is neither clear nor well-developed, leaving the intent and purpose of the essay ambiguous. The arguments are simplistic and not supported by real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning, which diminishes their impact. The conclusion is ineffective and fails to reinforce the thesis with practical implications. The organizational structure is weak, with ideas that are not coherently presented or logically connected through clear transitions and defined topic sentences. In terms of language and style, the essay employs a limited vocabulary, with word choices that are often inappropriate for the context, and sentence structures that are awkward and disjointed. The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which further impedes readability and detracts from the essay's overall quality. To improve, the essay needs a clear thesis, well-supported arguments with real-world examples, a logical structure with coherent transitions, appropriate and varied vocabulary, and meticulous attention to grammatical conventions.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is quite disorganized and lacks clarity and practical focus. The thesis is unclear, and the content is not developed with concrete, real-world evidence or pragmatic reasoning. The argument about the story and nature is repetitive and vague, leaving the reader without a clear understanding of the author's point. Additionally, the conclusion does not effectively reinforce the thesis or provide practical implications. Structurally, the essay falls short of the expected standards. It lacks a coherent organization, with no clear introduction, body, or conclusion. Transitions between ideas are absent, making the essay difficult to follow. The language and style used are inappropriate for the audience and purpose; there are numerous grammatical errors, misspellings, and issues with punctuation and capitalization.

Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel. Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men.        
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Certainly! Here is the feedback based on the values of clarity, coherence, grammar, and content:

---

**Feedback:**

**1. Clarity and Coherence:** 
Your essay provides an interesting summary of Joe Kurmaskie's experience cycling through the desert. However, some parts of your essay could be clearer and more coherent. Try to connect your ideas more smoothly and provide a consistent flow of thought. For example, adding transition words and rephrasing certain sentences will help the reader follow your narrative better.

**2. Grammar and Spelling:**
There are several grammatical errors and misspelled words that need correction. Here are some specific points:
- ""Certin"" should be ""Certain.""
- ""desribes"" should be ""describes.""
- ""hes"" should be ""his.""
- ""difinition"" should be ""definition.""
- ""scketle"" should be ""skeptical.""
- ""untill"" should be ""until.""
- ""aroun"" should be ""around.""
- ""sorching son"" should be ""scorching sun.""
- ""soluation"" should be ""solace.""

**3. Sentence Structure:**
Some of your sentences are fragmented or awkwardly structured. For instance, instead of ""he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end,"" you might write, ""he still had a long way to go until he reached the park, and he felt as if the journey would never end."" This improves readability.

**4. Content:**
You have captured the essence of the cyclist’s experience well, but adding more detail and analysis would strengthen your essay. For example, why does the cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from the older men? How does the setting specifically impact his journey and mental state? Delving deeper into these aspects will make your essay more insightful.

**5. Quotations and References:**
When including quotes from the text, ensure they are correctly integrated and punctuated. For example, instead of ""...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town,"" you could write, ""He 'arrived at the first town' and noticed that 'it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.'""

**6. Formatting:**
Ensure your essay is properly formatted. Indenting paragraphs and using appropriate punctuation will enhance readability.

---

**Revised Example:**

Certain features of the setting significantly affected the cyclist. In Joe Kurmaskie's essay, he describes his experiences cycling through the desert. When he ""arrived at the first town,"" he noticed that ""it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" Initially, the cyclist found this amusing and perhaps was a bit skeptical because the older men had described it as thriving.

21,71,"The essay demonstrates some effort to address how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, but it falls short in several critical areas. The thesis and overall argument are somewhat unclear, making it difficult to follow the main ideas. The essay does touch on various aspects of the setting, such as the sun, ghost towns, obstacles, and terrain, but these points are often presented without enough detail or real-world examples to support them effectively. Additionally, the essay lacks coherence and logical transitions between sentences and paragraphs, making it feel fragmented and disjointed. The language is imprecise, with numerous grammatical errors, awkward sentence constructions, and inappropriate word choices that detract from readability. These issues also impede the flow and make the narrative challenging to follow. Overall, the essay shows minimal control of standard writing conventions, and the frequent errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization further undermine the clarity and impact of the writing. To improve, the essay needs a clearer thesis, more detailed and well-supported arguments, better organization, and significant attention to language and grammar.",71,"Your essay identifies several features that impact the cyclist, such as the sun, ghost towns, obstacles, and terrain, which is a good start. However, there are areas where you can improve to make your writing clearer and more effective.

1. **Clarity and Specificity**: Your ideas are somewhat disorganized, and some sentences are difficult to understand. For example, ""THE THIRSTY-NESS REDUFROM HIM TO USE HIS LIMITED SUPPLY OF WATER"" is confusing. Consider rephrasing this to something clearer, like ""The intense heat made the cyclist thirsty, forcing him to use his limited water supply.""

2. **Logical Organization**: Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Start with a strong introduction that outlines the main points you will discuss. Each paragraph should focus on a single feature and explain how it affects the cyclist. For example, have one paragraph about the sun, another about ghost towns, and so on.

3. **Practical Language**: Use practical and precise language. Avoid vague phrases and ensure your word choice is appropriate for the context. For instance, instead of ""HE USES MUCH ENERGY TO SUMMER THE HELL,"" you could say, ""He expended a lot of energy to climb the steep hill.""

4. **Real-World Examples**: While you do mention specific features like ""TUMBLEWEEDS"" and ""PAVEMENT BLOCKING SNAKES,"" try to elaborate on how these obstacles impact the cyclist's journey in real-world terms. What specific challenges do they present?

5. **Grammar and Spelling**: Pay attention to grammar and spelling errors, as they can detract from the readability of your essay. For example, ""REDUFROM"" should be ""reduced,"" and ""RAM-SHACKLE SHEDS"" should be ""ramshackle sheds."" Proofreading your work can help catch these mistakes.

6. **Transitions and Flow**: Improve the flow of your essay by using smooth transitions between ideas. Instead of abruptly jumping from one point to another, use transitional phrases to guide the reader. For example, ""In addition to the sun's heat, the ghost towns also posed challenges...""

7. **Conclusion**: End with a strong conclusion that summarizes your main points and reinforces your thesis. This helps to give your essay a sense of completeness and leaves a lasting impression on the reader.

Here’s a revised version of the first part of your paragraph to demonstrate these points:

""The setting presents various features that significantly impact the cyclist. One major challenge is the intense heat of the sun, which makes the cyclist hot and thirsty, forcing him to use his limited water supply. This not only depletes his resources but also increases his risk of dehydration. Additionally, the run-down ghost towns, with their ramshackle sheds and rusty pumps, contribute to a sense of hopelessness. These towns lack the necessary amenities, leaving the cyclist without a place to refill his water and exacerbating","

TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for your effort in writing this essay. You've identified several key features in the setting that impact the cyclist, and your ideas show a clear understanding of how the environment can influence someone's experience. Here are some suggestions for improvement to help you refine your writing:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: Your essay would benefit from clearer and more coherent sentences. For instance, instead of ""THE SUN BEGINNING TO HEAT DOWN,"" you could say, ""The sun was beating down."" This makes your point clearer and more concise.

2. **Grammar and Sentence Structure**: Pay attention to grammar and sentence structure. For example, ""THE THIRSTY-NESS REDUFROM HIM TO USE HIS LIMITED SUPPLY OF WATER"" should be ""The thirst forced him to use his limited supply of water."" Additionally, ""ANOTHER FEATURE THAT CAUSED SOME PROBLEMS FOR THE CYCLIST WERE THE RUN DOWN GHOST TOWNS"" should be ""Another feature that caused problems for the cyclist was the run-down ghost towns.""

3. **Consistency in Tense**: Ensure that you maintain a consistent tense throughout your essay. For example, ""OBSTACLES SUCH AS TUMBLEWEEDS AND PAVEMENT BLOCKING SNAKES ALSO PLAYS"" should be ""Obstacles such as tumbleweeds and pavement-blocking snakes also played.""

4. **Detail and Explanation**: Some parts of your essay are unclear due to missing or incorrect words. For example, ""FEEL UP WITH AS HE BECAME DEHYDRATED"" could be rephrased to ""refill his water supply, leading to dehydration."" Ensure each sentence is complete and fully explains your point.

5. **Quotation Marks and Capitalization**: Use quotation marks and capitalization appropriately. For example, ""RUN DOWN GHOST TOWNS"" should be ""run-down 'ghost towns'."" Also, avoid using all caps, as it can be distracting.

6. **Conclusion**: Your last sentence appears incomplete: ""HE USES MUCH ENERGY TO SUMMER THE HELL, HE WAS ??? ???? ??? ???"" Make sure to complete your thoughts and provide a clear conclusion.

Revised Version:
The setting has several features that affect the cyclist in various ways. One feature is the sun beating down, which makes the cyclist hot and thirsty, forcing him to use his limited supply of water. The sun, therefore, impacts him both physically and resource-wise. Another problematic feature is the run-down ghost towns, consisting of ramshackle sheds and several rusty pumps. These sights lead the cyclist to feel hopeless, especially since there is no water available, causing dehydration. 

Obstacles such as tumbleweeds and pavement-blocking snakes also play a role in hindering the cyclist's progress on the road, making him slow down to just 12 mph. Finally, the terrain itself poses a significant challenge. A long, sloping",0.9392876039494762,0.9363875375623443
22,75,"The essay falls significantly short in addressing the prompt effectively. The thesis is unclear and the arguments are undeveloped, lacking any real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning to support the points being made. The conclusion is equally weak, failing to reinforce the thesis with any practical implications. The overall structure is disorganized, with no clear flow of ideas, coherent transitions, or well-defined topic sentences, making it difficult for the reader to follow the argument. The language used is imprecise and lacks variety, with numerous grammatical errors, incorrect spelling, and awkward sentence structures that impede readability. In essence, the essay requires substantial improvements in clarity, content, organization, and linguistic precision to meet the standards expected by the teacher.",75,"FEEDBACK: You've made a good start in trying to break down the author's purpose in concluding the story with that particular paragraph. However, there are several areas where your writing can be improved to better meet the criteria for effective communication.

1. **Clarity and Coherence:** Your explanation is somewhat unclear and could be more coherent. Try to avoid phrases like ""I think to say"" and ""I think that is why"" as they make your argument sound tentative. Instead, be assertive and clear in your statements. For example, you could write: ""The author concludes the story with that paragraph to signify the cyclical nature of the protagonist's journey. The blooming of the hibiscus symbolizes her readiness to face challenges anew.""

2. **Support with Real-World Examples:** Your argument would be stronger if you supported it with more concrete reasoning. In this case, you have quoted a relevant part of the story, which is good. However, you should explain how this quote supports your interpretation. For example: ""She states, 'In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again,' which suggests that the protagonist sees the blooming hibiscus as a sign of new beginnings and personal growth.""

3. **Organization and Structure:** Your paragraph needs a bit more structure to improve its flow. Start with a clear thesis statement, then provide evidence, and conclude with how this evidence supports your thesis. Here's a suggested structure:
   - **Thesis Statement:** The author concludes the story with this paragraph to highlight the protagonist's readiness to start anew with the blooming of the hibiscus.
   - **Evidence:** The quote ""In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again"" underscores this cyclical renewal.
   - **Conclusion:** This indicates that the protagonist associates the blooming hibiscus with a fresh start, reinforcing the theme of resilience and new beginnings.

4. **Grammar and Language Use:** Pay attention to grammar and punctuation to ensure your writing is polished and professional. For instance, ""hibiscus"" should be ""hibiscuses"" to match the plural context if referring to multiple blooms, or simply ""the hibiscus"" if singular.

Overall, you are on the right track, but your writing will benefit from clearer structure, stronger support with specific examples, and a focus on grammatical accuracy. Keep working on these aspects to enhance the clarity and impact of your essays. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!","

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concude the story with that paragraph because its what she solemely promoted herself.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Upon reviewing the provided essay, it is evident that it lacks clarity, organization, and depth. The thesis statement is almost non-existent, and there is a lack of coherent development and support for any argument. The single sentence provided does not adequately introduce or conclude the topic, nor does it present a clear opinion or argument regarding the effects computers have on people or censorship in libraries. There are no real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning to support the writer’s stance, which significantly weakens the content. Additionally, the sentence structure is awkward, with grammatical errors that hinder readability. The absence of transitional phrases and logical flow makes the essay difficult to follow.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started. I think that is why because she says In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay. Here are some observations and suggestions to help improve your writing:

1. **Clarify Your Thesis**: Your concluding statement provides an interpretation of the story, which is a great start. However, it would be beneficial to clearly state your thesis at the beginning of your essay. This will help set the stage for your analysis and make your argument more coherent.

2. **Quotation Integration**: When you include a quote from the text, make sure to integrate it smoothly into your own writing. Currently, the quote feels somewhat separate from your analysis. You can frame it more effectively by introducing the quote and explaining its significance in your own words.

3. **Grammar and Syntax**: There are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrases, such as ""The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say..."" and “I think that is why because she says..."" Rephrasing these sentences will enhance readability. For instance, you could say, ""I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph to illustrate that...""

4. **Be Specific**: It's important to be clear and specific in your analysis. Instead of saying ""I think,” you could use more assertive language like ""The author intends to convey…” This will make your argument stronger and more persuasive.

5. **Expand Your Analysis**: While your essay touches on the conclusion of the story, expanding your analysis to include more details and examples from the text will strengthen your argument. Try to explain why the return of the hibiscus and the changing seasons are significant symbols in the context of the story.

6. **Proofread**: Finally, always proofread your work for spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors. This will ensure that your writing is polished and professional.

Here's a revised version of your paragraph to illustrate these points:

""The author concludes the story with the final paragraph to illustrate the cyclical nature of the protagonist's journey. When the hibiscus starts to grow back, it symbolizes a return to the beginning, suggesting that the protagonist will have another opportunity to face her challenges. This is evident when she states, 'In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.' This line indicates that the protagonist is hopeful and ready to confront her trials once more, highlighting the themes of resilience and renewal.""

23,77,"The essay lacks clarity and focus, making it difficult to grasp the main idea. While the author attempts to conclude the story by highlighting Saeng's resolve to retake a failed test, the reasoning behind this resolution is not well-developed or supported by specific details from the text. The essay does not adhere closely to the prompt and provides minimal relevant information from the story. Language issues, such as grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures, impede readability and detract from the overall coherence of the essay. The narrative is disjointed and fails to engage the reader, showing a need for better organization and more effective use of transitional elements. To improve, the writer should focus on developing a clear thesis, providing specific examples from the text, and ensuring grammatical accuracy for better readability.",77,"The passage you have written has a meaningful idea but needs improvement for clarity and coherence. Let's break it down to enhance the overall quality:

1. **Clarity and Conciseness**: The sentence is quite long and complex, making it difficult to follow. Simplify your sentences to convey your ideas more clearly.
   
   *Example*: ""The author concludes the story with Saeng deciding to retake the test she failed. She feels more comfortable in her new home now that she has found something that reminds her of her past.""

2. **Thesis and Argument Development**: Your paragraph lacks a clear thesis and does not fully develop the argument. You need to clearly state why Saeng’s realization is significant to the conclusion of the story.

   *Example*: ""The author ends the story with Saeng's decision to retake the test to illustrate her growing sense of belonging in her new home.""

3. **Use of Real-World Examples**: Integrate real-world relevance to strengthen your argument. Why is it important that Saeng feels at home, and how does this relate to broader themes or lessons?

   *Example*: ""Just as people find comfort in familiar surroundings when adjusting to new environments, Saeng’s connection to her past helps her build confidence in her new life.""

4. **Grammar and Style**: There are minor grammatical issues, such as the lack of an apostrophe in ""shes"" which should be ""she's."" Additionally, aim for varied word choice to keep your writing engaging.

   *Example*: ""She’s found something that reminds her of her previous life, giving her the courage to face challenges anew.""

5. **Logical Flow and Transitions**: Ensure your ideas flow logically from one to the next with smooth transitions. This will make your writing easier to read and understand.

   *Example*: ""Having found a reminder of her past, Saeng feels more at ease in her new surroundings, which gives her the determination to retake the test she previously failed.""

By focusing on these areas, you can transform your writing to be more clear, concise, and impactful. Don't hesitate to ask for further clarification on any of these points. Keep practicing, and you'll continue to improve!","

He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay lacks clarity and practical relevance, making it difficult for the reader to follow the main points. The thesis is neither clear nor well-developed, leaving the intent and purpose of the essay ambiguous. The arguments are simplistic and not supported by real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning, which diminishes their impact. The conclusion is ineffective and fails to reinforce the thesis with practical implications. The organizational structure is weak, with ideas that are not coherently presented or logically connected through clear transitions and defined topic sentences.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is by herself, and letting herself know that she is going to try the test she failed again because she is starting to get used to her new home now that shes found something that reminds her of her life before she left.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay! Here are some constructive points to help you enhance your writing further:

1. **Clarity and Structure**: Your paragraph conveys the key idea, but it could benefit from clearer structure and more detail. Try to break down your thoughts into smaller, more digestible sentences. This will help your reader follow your argument more easily.

2. **Grammar and Mechanics**: Pay attention to punctuation and grammar. For instance, ""shes"" should be ""she's."" Also, consider breaking the long sentence into two or three shorter ones to enhance readability.

3. **Specificity**: You mention that Saeng found something that reminds her of her past, but you don't specify what that is. Adding this detail would make your conclusion stronger and more vivid.

4. **Depth of Analysis**: Expand on why the reminder of her past is significant for Saeng. How does it help her feel more at home? What does this suggest about her character or the broader themes of the story?

5. **Engagement**: Your concluding sentence should leave a lasting impression. Consider rephrasing to make it more impactful, perhaps by highlighting Saeng's growth or newfound determination.

Here's a revised version incorporating these points:

""The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's journey toward resilience and adaptation. Alone and introspective, Saeng resolves to retake the test she previously failed, symbolizing her growing comfort in her new environment. This shift occurs as she discovers an element that connects her to her past life, a reminder that bridges her old and new worlds. This discovery not only fosters a sense of belonging but also reignites her determination to succeed, highlighting her inner strength and the theme of perseverance throughout the narrative.""

24,81,"The essay demonstrates a commendable effort in capturing the essence of Narciso Rodriguez's reflections on his home and family. The author successfully conveys the heartwarming and appreciative tone that Rodriguez created, specifically highlighting the sense of comfort and unity within his family environment. However, the essay could benefit from a clearer and more relevant thesis statement to guide the reader. The arguments should be more practical and supported with direct, real-world examples from the memoir to strengthen the case. The conclusion does a reasonable job of reinforcing the thesis but could emphasize practical implications more effectively. The organization of the essay is generally clear, with coherent transitions and well-defined topic sentences, although there are moments where the structure could be tighter. Language use is decent, but several grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and some awkward phrasing detract from the overall clarity and precision. Improving these elements would enhance the essay's readability and effectiveness. Overall, the essay is interesting and generally maintains a smooth narrative flow, but it could be more engaging with better transitional elements and stronger linkage between points.",81,"The essay demonstrates a heartfelt connection to the themes of home and family, and you have captured the mood of appreciation effectively. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to align with our class's writing goals.

1. **Thesis Statement:** Your essay would benefit greatly from a clearer thesis statement that explicitly states the main point you will be discussing. This will provide a solid foundation for your arguments and make your essay more cohesive.

2. **Development of Arguments:** While you touch on key elements like the author’s appreciation for his parents and the sense of family, these points need further development with specific, real-world examples. For instance, you could elaborate on particular moments from the memoir that illustrate these feelings more vividly.

3. **Quotations and Analysis:** You've included relevant quotes, which is excellent. However, ensure that these quotes are integrated smoothly into your text and accompanied by detailed analysis. Explain how each quote supports your overall argument and the mood you’re trying to convey.

4. **Organization and Transitions:** Your essay would be easier to follow with well-defined topic sentences and smoother transitions between points. For example, clearly separate your discussion of the mood from your analysis of specific aspects of the author’s life and heritage.

5. **Language and Grammar:** Pay attention to spelling and grammatical errors such as ""comftable"" (comfortable), ""enviroment"" (environment), ""familly"" (family), and ""wiched"" (which). Also, be mindful of sentence structure and punctuation to ensure clarity and readability.

6. **Concluding Thoughts:** Your conclusion should reinforce your thesis and main points, tying everything together in a coherent summary. The current conclusion is a good start but can be more impactful if you succinctly restate how the author’s appreciation for his family and heritage is conveyed through the memoir.

**Specific Suggestions:**
- Revise your thesis to be more explicit about the main argument.
- Expand on examples and provide detailed explanations on how they support your thesis.
- Improve transitions between paragraphs to maintain a logical flow.
- Proofread your work for spelling and grammatical accuracy.

My grandparents moved to the @CAPS2.S when my mom was just six. They wanted to give her and her brothers and sisters a better life. This is why I am thankful. I live in the @LOCATION1. The mood is also happy because everyone loved eachother. They didnt have the nicest home, but it was full of love. The music was always playing and Family came a lot. The door was always open in

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay does not fully meet the criteria outlined in the guidelines. The content lacks a clear, relevant thesis and offers minimal development of arguments with real-world examples. The conclusion, while attempting to reinforce the initial sentiment, falls short in effectiveness. Organizationally, the essay is weak, with unclear transitions and poorly defined topic sentences, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. The language and style are hampered by frequent grammatical errors, incorrect punctuation, and a limited, often repetitive vocabulary. Additionally, the essay significantly lacks coherence and logical structure, resulting in a disjointed narrative. To improve, focus on creating a clear thesis, supporting arguments with detailed real-world examples, and ensuring logical flow with well-defined topic sentences and smooth transitions.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood of this memior is slightly diffucult, somewhat depresing, yet gratefulness and now I am going to explain to you how. The mood is slightly diffucult and depressing because there is a different culture and a brand new language. Also in the united states you have to have get a new job. This short story is also gratefull because you have a amazing oppertunity to start a very better life and get a great education.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay exhibits a basic understanding of the mood in the memoir, identifying it as ""slightly difficult, somewhat depressing, yet grateful."" However, the analysis lacks depth and clarity, with minimal evidence from the memoir to support these points. The thesis statement is not clearly articulated, and the arguments are not well-developed or supported by specific examples. The structure is somewhat disjointed, with an abrupt transition from the mood discussion to the summary of Narciso Rodriguez's story. The essay's language and style contain several grammatical errors and misspellings, such as ""diffucult,"" ""depresing,"" and ""gratefull."" Sentence structures are often awkward and lack variety. Additionally, the narrative flow is hindered by the absence of coherent transitions and well-defined topic sentences, making the essay difficult to follow. Overall, the essay needs significant improvement in clarity, organization, and the use of supporting evidence to effectively analyze the mood of the memoir.

TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Thank you for sharing your essay on the theme of home and family. You have chosen a heartfelt topic that resonates with many people, and you conveyed some meaningful insights. Here are some suggestions to help you improve your essay:

1. **Clarity and Structure**:
   - Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Start with an introduction that outlines what you will discuss. Follow with body paragraphs that each focus on a specific point, and conclude with a summary that ties everything together.
   - For example, you can start with a sentence introducing the author and the main theme of their work, then move on to discussing specific aspects like the mood, the environment, and the sense of family.

2. **Grammar and Spelling**:
   - Pay attention to spelling and grammar. There are a few errors that need correction, such as ""comftable"" (comfortable), ""enviroment"" (environment), ""familly"" (family), ""wiched"" (which), ""deseverd"" (deserved).
   - Also, ensure that punctuation is used correctly. For instance, use commas and periods to separate sentences clearly and make your writing easier to read.

3. **Quotations and Citations**:
   - When you use quotations, integrate them smoothly into your sentences and make sure they are accurate. For example: Growing up in this environment instilled in him a great sense that ""family"" has nothing to do with being a blood relative.
   - Cite the source properly if there is a specific reference you are drawing from.

4. **Expression and Vocabulary**:
   - Aim to use a varied vocabulary to make your writing more engaging. Instead of repeating words like ""appreciation"" and ""together,"" try using synonyms or rephrasing your sentences.
   - For example, instead of ""Narciso Rodriguez show his appreciation,"" you might say, ""Narciso Rodriguez demonstrates his gratitude.""

5. **Content and Analysis**:
   - Your essay touches upon important points but needs deeper analysis. Explain why the author's appreciation for his home and family is significant. How does it impact him or his life?
   - Discuss the themes and emotions more thoroughly. For example, you mentioned bravery—expand on this by exploring what sacrifices were made and why they were important.

Here’s a revised version of your opening to illustrate these suggestions:

---

""Home and family are fundamental aspects that all of us cherish. The author creates a heartwarming and appreciative mood by describing the comfortable atmosphere of his home, where everyone enjoys time together. He emphasizes that being a family is not just about being blood relatives. Narciso Rodriguez shows his deep appreciation for his parents, who made significant sacrifices to provide him with a better life, even though it meant leaving their own families behind. This brave decision highlights the strength and love that define his sense of home. Through his narrative, the author expresses his gratitude for both his parents and his Hispanic heritage.""

25,88,"The essay effectively addresses the topic of censorship in books, movies, and music, presenting a strong and clear stance against the removal of materials deemed offensive. The content is compelling, with a thought-provoking thesis and well-developed supporting arguments that demonstrate a high level of originality and creative thought. The organization of the essay is commendable, featuring an engaging introduction, well-structured body paragraphs, and smooth transitions that maintain a cohesive flow of ideas. The language and style are vibrant and varied, employing imaginative vocabulary and creative sentence structures that enhance the overall impact of the essay. Additionally, the essay demonstrates strong control over standard writing conventions, with minimal errors that do not impede readability. The conclusion provides a fresh perspective, reinforcing the essay's central argument and leaving the reader with a lasting impression. However, the use of placeholders such as ""@CAPS1"" and ""@CAPS2"" disrupts the reading experience, and the essay would benefit from more specific examples and smoother integration of these references. Overall, the essay showcases a high degree of originality, creative expression, and effective communication.",88,"**TEACHER FEEDBACK:**

Your essay presents a compelling and thoughtful argument against censorship in various forms of media, beautifully illustrating your perspective with well-chosen examples. Your stance is clear, and you make a strong case for the importance of historical context and the responsibility of parents in moderating content for their children.

**Strengths:**
1. **Clear Positioning and Reasoning:** Your argument is well-defined, and you support it with specific examples from books, movies, and music. This provides a robust foundation for your viewpoint and makes your essay persuasive.
2. **Engagement with Historical Context:** Your discussion about historical books and their reflection of past societal norms adds depth to your argument. This is a sophisticated point that showcases your ability to think critically about cultural and historical contexts.
3. **Varied Examples:** By including examples from different media—books, movies, and music—you demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the topic. This diversity of examples helps to reinforce your central argument effectively.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Transitions Between Paragraphs:** While your ideas are solid, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the overall flow. This will help guide the reader seamlessly from one point to the next. Consider using transitional phrases or sentences to link your ideas more coherently.
2. **Language and Word Choice:** There are some minor grammatical and spelling errors (e.g., ""neccessarily"" should be ""necessarily"", ""leagally"" should be ""legally"") and awkward phrasing that occasionally disrupts the reading experience. Careful proofreading and perhaps the use of a thesaurus can help refine your language and ensure clarity.
3. **Placeholder Text:** The placeholders marked with ""@"" need to be replaced with actual names or terms. This will help maintain the essay's coherence and enhance its impact.
4. **Conclusion Enhancement:** Your conclusion effectively reiterates your main argument, but it could benefit from a more innovative or thought-provoking perspective. This would leave a stronger impression on your reader and underscore the originality of your ideas.

**Suggestions for Growth:**
- **Explore Creative Language:** Try using more varied and imaginative language to make your writing more engaging. This could involve experimenting with metaphors, similes, or more vivid descriptions.
- **Refine Sentence Fluency:** Work on crafting sentences that flow smoothly and maintain the reader's interest. Mixing short, impactful sentences with longer, descriptive ones can create a more dynamic reading experience.
- **Dialogue and Discussion:** I encourage you to engage in discussions about your ideas with your peers or with me. This can help you refine your arguments further and explore different perspectives.

Overall, your essay is a thoughtful and well-argued piece that reflects your unique voice and critical thinking skills. With some polishing and attention to the areas mentioned, your writing will become even more powerful and engaging. Keep pushing the boundaries of your expression and exploring new ideas with confidence!","

Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: customer's as well. For instance think about a movie store. If the only movies sold were @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 there would be a lot less people wanting to go to that store, because then it just turns into a child's store. Even censoring the movies would not be effective because your taking away the art of having an unfiltered movie.                   So my simple solution is obvious. Movies have ratings based on maturity content, so why shouldn't books. Books that deal with more controversal

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and focused argument against censorship in libraries, using vivid examples and logical reasoning to support its points. The content is rich with specific details and examples, such as the comparison between book censorship and movie ratings, which effectively illustrate the writer's perspective. The organization, while coherent, could benefit from stronger transitions between paragraphs to enhance the overall flow and make the structure more engaging. The word choice is varied and suitable, effectively conveying the intended message with an appropriate level of precision. Sentence fluency is generally smooth, with a good mix of sentence structures that keep the reader engaged. However, some minor grammatical and spelling errors are present, which occasionally impede readability. Overall, the essay demonstrates a strong command of conventions, though attention to detail in proofreading would further improve its clarity and impact.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: ratings based on maturity content, so why shouldn't books. Books that deal with more controversal content shouldn't be placed in the shelves next to young readers' books, and they should have a label indicating that the specific book @MONTH1 contain material not suitable for a person under a specific age. People trying to censor entertainment and look into the best interest of their loved ones is perfectly fine, but you cant blindfold them forever. Were all on the same planet and we all reach

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: If there is an offensive book or a bad @CAPS2 and someone doesn't like it and feels the need to remove it, that is @CAPS3 but then they aren't thinking of what other people might like. I have always heard the saying, 'If everybody liked the same thing, it would be a boring world.' I find this to be completely true.      If everybody liked the same thing, then let anybody that enters the library remove an offensive item. However, if this happens, authors won't want to keep writing books and

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear stance against censorship in libraries and provides a personal perspective to support this viewpoint. The thesis, although somewhat traditional, is articulated clearly and is supported by relevant arguments and personal anecdotes. However, to enhance its effectiveness, the essay could benefit from a more engaging and imaginative introduction. The body paragraphs are well-structured, but transitions between ideas could be smoother to improve the overall flow. The conclusion effectively reiterates the main argument but could offer a more innovative perspective to leave a stronger impression. The word choice is varied and appropriate, demonstrating a good command of vocabulary. Sentence structures are engaging and diverse, contributing to a pleasant reading experience.

Overall, the essay demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and reflects a genuine personal voice, aligning well with the teacher's emphasis on originality and creative expression.



---------------------------

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Most modern day book, movies, music, etc. do a fairly good job of placing warning in the form of '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticks on their covers. But books from before this practice began to happen @MONTH1 be found more offensive then books today. Why? Well, that's because many books of the past use words that today are found offensive. But those books, movies, and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem. There are examples of how each catagory is in today's society.     Take the book 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', written by @PERSON1, for example. In that story, there are words that are used to describe people of that time.. Back when @PERSON1 wrote the book, it was perfectly fine to use those words on those people, but in today's modern world, that is a book that has been on the list for being banned. It is offensive to use that word on people today, so parent groups and others are trying to get that book pulled off of shelves in hopes of erasing what was done in the past. I don't believe that a book should be banned for it's content, but rather how well it teaches its reader through its words. If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and the culture of that time, then it shouldn't be banned at all. It should be read.     Movies have a rating system for a reason. There are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience. People must be of a certain age to rent, buy, or view these kind of movies 'leagally'. Not too many people listen to that system, even though it has exsisted for years. A horror film is not suitable for a @CAPS15 of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on @CAPS4. Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a @CAPS15 nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong. That is the fault of the parents. They were the ones who let their @CAPS15 watch that movie in the first place. So the movie shouldn't be held responsible for the @CAPS15. If the movie was intended for a more mature audience, that's the way it should stay.     And that brings us to music. There is a lot of music in today's age that can be considered very offensive. There are only a few 'pure' genres, free of the cursing that is used in many of the others today. But children, teen, and adults all find their favorite kind, and you can't change their minds then. The governement has issued that all music containing harsh words, horrid images to the mind, gruesome scenes, and other elements that are offensive to people, must carry a sticker on it. The black and white '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticker. When parents see this sticker on the @CAPS7, @NUM1 download, or whatever their @CAPS15 is using, then they know that it is more than likely not right for their @CAPS15 to listen to. Doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it means that there is a slight chance that their minds will not be tainted by 'garbage'.     So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't neccessarily mean that it is the same to another person. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society. People will still argue that books such as 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON2', '@CAPS10 in the @CAPS11', and many, many more books like them should be banned. They will always fight that movies such as 'A @CAPS12 on @CAPS13 @CAPS14,' '@DATE1 the @NUM2', or '@CAPS15's @CAPS16' should be removed from store shelves because it gave them nightmares as a @CAPS19 or it gives their @CAPS15 nightmares because they saw it. And they will always try to fight and say that artist like @CAPS17' @CAPS18, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS19 @CAPS20 are not suited for their @CAPS15. Well, this pattern has been going on for years. Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for a adult audience, not for a @CAPS15 of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue about what should be on shelves and what should not, remember that it might be that parent's fault for letting their @CAPS15 view it in the first place.

FEEDBACK: 
","### Feedback:

#### Content and Argumentation:
1. **Thesis Statement**: Your essay presents a clear stance on the issue of censoring books, movies, and music. However, the thesis could be more explicitly stated at the beginning to guide the reader through your argument.

2. **Supporting Evidence**: You provide examples from books and movies, but these examples are not fully developed. It would be beneficial to elaborate on specific instances and how they illustrate your point. For example, instead of using placeholders like '@CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', provide real titles and authors to strengthen your argument.

3. **Logical Flow**: Your points on books, movies, and music are somewhat disjointed. Consider using clearer topic sentences and transitions to improve the coherence of your essay.

#### Structure and Organization:
1. **Paragraph Structure**: Each paragraph should start with a clear topic sentence that outlines the main idea. Ensure that all sentences within the paragraph support the topic sentence and contribute to the overall argument.

2. **Conclusion**: The conclusion reiterates your main points well, but it could be more concise. Focus on summarizing your key arguments and reinforcing your thesis.

#### Language and Grammar:
1. **Word Choice**: Be mindful of the words you choose. For example, ""leagally"" should be ""legally,"" and ""exsisted"" should be ""existed."" Proofreading your work can help catch these errors.

2. **Clarity**: Some sentences are confusing due to poor word choice or structure. For instance, ""But books from before this practice began to happen @MONTH1 be found more offensive then books today"" is unclear. Ensure each sentence clearly conveys your intended meaning.

3. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are multiple grammatical errors, such as ""it's"" instead of ""its,"" ""catagory"" instead of ""category,"" and ""neccessarily"" instead of ""necessarily."" These mistakes can distract from your argument and should be corrected.

#### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Develop Examples**: Replace placeholders with real examples and elaborate on them to strengthen your argument.
2. **Proofread**: Carefully proofread your essay to correct grammatical and spelling errors.
3. **Transitional Phrases**: Use transitional phrases to improve the flow of your argument between paragraphs.
4. **Conciseness**: Be more concise, especially in your conclusion, to ensure your main points are clear and impactful.

Overall, your essay addresses an important issue and presents a clear stance. With more detailed examples, improved coherence, and careful proofreading, your writing will be much stronger. Keep up the good work and continue to refine your skills!",0.9103202247784523,0.9288004172667581
26,91,"The essay effectively addresses the setting's impact on the cyclist, using specific examples to illustrate how various features, such as the hills, the road signs, and the abandoned grape juice factory, contribute to his challenges and eventual relief. However, the response could benefit from deeper analysis and more detailed exploration of these elements to fully capture their significance. The language is clear, and there is a basic structure in place, but the essay would be more engaging with varied vocabulary and sentence structures. The transitions between ideas are present but could be smoother to enhance the overall flow. Additionally, while the essay stays on topic, there are moments where it could delve deeper into the cyclist's emotional and physical journey to provide a richer narrative. Overall, the response is cohesive and understandable, but it could be more compelling with more vivid language and a more thorough examination of the setting’s effects on the cyclist.",91,"Your essay, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" does a commendable job of identifying key elements in the setting that impact the cyclist, and you've made some insightful observations about how these features contribute to his overall experience. Let's delve deeper into how you can enhance your creative voice and develop your analysis further.

Firstly, your recognition of the hills and the sun as challenging aspects for the cyclist is spot on. However, try to expand on this by adding more descriptive language that immerses the reader in the scene. How might the hills have physically and mentally exhausted the cyclist? Could you describe the heat in a more vivid way to help us feel his discomfort?

Your interpretation of the road sign and its effect on the cyclist introduces a layer of irony that is quite engaging. However, your quotation integration could be smoother. Instead of quoting the speed limit numbers as placeholders, try to weave the quotes seamlessly into your narrative. For example, ""The road sign's stark command, 'Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,' must have felt like a cruel mockery as the cyclist struggled to maintain even a fraction of the speed limit in the oppressive heat.""

The mention of the grape juice sign as a source of ironic cruelty is a unique and original observation. To strengthen this point, consider exploring why the cyclist might have felt this way. Was he particularly thirsty, or did the sign remind him of something unattainable in his current state? Adding these layers can make your analysis richer and more thought-provoking.

Your conclusion about the bait shop offering relief is well presented. You effectively show the contrast between the negative and positive aspects of the setting. To enhance this section, delve deeper into the cyclist's emotions upon seeing the bait shop. How did his mood shift? Can you use more evocative language to describe his ""overwhelming urge"" and the sense of relief it brought?

Overall, your essay has a strong foundation, and with a few adjustments, it can shine even brighter. Focus on enriching your descriptions and providing deeper insights into the cyclist's experience. This will not only engage your readers more effectively but also showcase your creative potential and originality. Keep pushing the boundaries of your expression, and don't hesitate to take risks with your writing. You're on a great path!

Keep up the great work, and I look forward to seeing how your unique voice continues to develop.

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to discuss the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the story. The ideas are underdeveloped and the content is minimal, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the intended message. There is a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points being made, which weakens the overall argument. The response also tends to wander off-topic and does not adhere closely to the prompt. The language used is simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors, such as ""shes"" instead of ""she's"" and ""sentance"" instead of ""sentence."" These errors distract from the readability of the essay and hinder its effectiveness. Additionally, the essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes the narrative difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing detailed support from the story, maintaining clarity in addressing the prompt, enhancing vocabulary, and ensuring a smooth flow of ideas with proper transitions.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: According to @PERSON1, economic @CAPS1, every hour you spend on the computer, you raise your electricity bill by @MONEY2. The average @CAPS2 spends @NUM1 hours on the computer everyday. I believe that spending too much time on the computer could be a bad thing. You have economic loss from the electric bill, health loss because you won't be able to exercise as much, and community less because you won't spen as much with your community. Financial loss is something that many people are concerned

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and focused argument against excessive computer use, supported by recognizable main ideas: financial loss, health issues, and community disintegration. The originality of the thesis could be improved by providing a more unique or thought-provoking perspective on the topic. The essay is satisfactorily organized, with a basic introduction, body, and conclusion, though the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow of ideas. The word choice effectively conveys the intended message, but there is room for more varied and imaginative language to make the essay more engaging. The sentences generally flow well, though some constructions could be more fluid and varied to maintain the reader’s interest. The essay demonstrates control of standard writing conventions, but there are noticeable errors in spelling and grammar that slightly impede readability. Overall, the essay is clear and persuasive but could benefit from more creative expression and polished language use to fully align with the teacher's emphasis on originality and creative expression.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: In the essay, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit there are many features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. Many of these features affect him in a negative way. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist. I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait. All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Certainly! Here is some constructive feedback on the student's essay:

**Feedback:**

Dear [Student's Name],

Thank you for submitting your essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" You have done a commendable job in identifying and discussing how different features of the setting affect the cyclist. Here are some points to help you further improve your writing:

1. **Introduction and Conclusion:**
   - **Introduction:** Your essay could benefit from a more robust introduction that provides context for the reader and states the thesis clearly. For example, you could introduce the essay's main themes and how the setting influences the cyclist's journey.
   - **Conclusion:** While you do summarize the main points, try to restate the thesis in a way that encapsulates the overall impact of the setting on the cyclist, offering a final reflection or insight.

2. **Clarity and Specificity:**
   - **Details:** When you mention certain features, such as the ""hills"" and the ""sun,"" try to be more specific about how they affect the cyclist. For example, ""The steep hills and the relentless sun significantly drained the cyclist's energy and morale.""
   - **Quotes:** Integrate quotes more smoothly into your sentences. For example, instead of ""The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2,"" you could say, “The cyclist struggled to maintain speed, noting the irony in the ‘Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit’ sign as he could barely pedal at @NUM2 mph.”

3. **Grammar and Word Choice:**
   - **Exasperated vs. Exacerbated:** Use ""exacerbated"" instead of ""exasperated"" in the context of worsening the cyclist's condition.
   - **Word Choice:** Avoid repetitive phrases like ""probably felt"" and ""probably made him feel."" They can be replaced with more assertive language to convey the impact more confidently.

4. **Flow and Coherence:**
   - **Transitions:** Ensure that your essay flows smoothly from one point to the next. For instance, you can use transitional phrases like ""Furthermore,"" ""In addition,"" and ""Moreover"" to connect your ideas better.

5. **Analysis and Insight:**
   - **Deeper Analysis:** Offer deeper analysis on how the setting elements relate to the overall theme or message of the essay. For example, discuss how the setting’s challenges might symbolize broader life challenges and the cyclist’s resilience.

Here's a revised example of a section from your essay:

**Original:** ""Another feature was the road sign that said 'Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit' 'The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.' The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it.""

**Revised:** ""Another challenging feature of the setting was the road sign that read 'Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit",0.9034461353237753,0.8919464921182483
27,92,"The essay lacks clarity, structure, and strong content, making it difficult to engage with and understand. The thesis statement is vague and lacks originality, failing to present a unique or thought-provoking idea about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The essay does not develop supporting arguments creatively, and the conclusion is ineffective and fails to provide a fresh perspective. The organization is disjointed, with a lack of clear flow and smooth transitions between ideas, leading to a confusing and fragmented narrative. The language and style are monotonous, with a limited vocabulary and repetitive sentence structures that do not captivate the reader. Additionally, the essay contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that further detract from its readability. Overall, the essay does not meet the standards for originality, creative expression, or imaginative language use as outlined in the guidelines.",92,"Your essay provides a solid starting point in discussing the challenges a cyclist might face on their journey. I appreciate how you identify specific obstacles, such as snakes, rough terrain, and rocks, which adds a layer of realism and detail to your writing. This helps the reader visualize the difficulties a cyclist might encounter, which is a great step toward engaging your audience.

However, there are several areas where you can enhance your essay to make it even more compelling and coherent:

1. **Organization and Flow**: Your ideas are currently presented in a somewhat disjointed manner. Try to organize your thoughts into clearer, more distinct paragraphs. For instance, you could have one paragraph discussing the physical challenges (like rocks and rough terrain) and another focusing on the importance of situational awareness and independence for cyclists. This will help your essay flow more smoothly and make it easier for readers to follow your argument.

2. **Specificity and Detail**: You've mentioned some potential hazards, but it would be even more engaging if you included more vivid descriptions or examples. For instance, you could describe a specific scenario where a cyclist navigates a rocky path or encounters a snake, and how they handle those situations. This would not only make your essay more interesting but also provide a clearer picture of the cyclist's experience.

3. **Sentence Structure and Language**: Varying your sentence structure can make your writing more dynamic. Currently, some sentences are quite short and choppy. Try combining some of your ideas into complex sentences to improve the flow. Additionally, watch out for repetitive phrases and minor grammatical errors. For example, ""That's why it's important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves"" could be revised for clarity and correctness: ""That's why it's crucial for cyclists to rely on their own judgment.""

4. **Creativity and Originality**: Your essay would benefit from a bit more of your unique voice and creativity. Consider adding a personal anecdote or a hypothetical story to illustrate your points. This can make your essay stand out and resonate more with your readers.

5. **Proofreading**: There are a few grammatical issues that need attention, such as ""theres"" instead of ""there's"" and missing punctuation marks. Careful proofreading can help minimize these errors and ensure your writing is polished and professional.

Overall, you've made a good effort in highlighting the importance of awareness and preparation for cyclists. With some refinement in organization, detail, and language, your essay can become even more impactful and enjoyable to read. Keep exploring your creative potential and don't hesitate to push the boundaries of your expression!","

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Computers are very important, I dont know anyone who does not need one. But some people say that it distracts you from exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friend. Do I agree? No I disagree with this situation because computers are a modern day tech that people use. They say it distracts you from interacting with family and friends but a computer is the number one way to talk to long distance friends and family, @CAPS1 without a computer how will those people who work

TEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a clear stance on the importance of computers in modern life, demonstrating a strong grasp of the topic. Your arguments are focused and supported with relevant examples, such as the use of social media platforms like MySpace and Facebook for maintaining long-distance relationships, and the necessity of computers for business and research purposes. The introduction succinctly sets the stage for your argument, and the conclusion effectively reinforces your main points while offering practical advice on balancing computer use with other activities.

However, the structure of the essay could be improved for better readability. Organizing your points into distinct paragraphs with smooth transitions would enhance the flow of ideas. For example, separating the discussion on social media, business use, and research into individual paragraphs would make your essay more coherent. Additionally, while your vocabulary is appropriate and varied, further refinement in word choice could add more precision and interest to your writing.

Your sentence structures are varied and mostly effective, contributing to a smooth reading experience. Still, addressing some repetitive phrases and minor grammatical errors would elevate the overall quality. For instance, consistent capitalization, punctuation, and spelling accuracy are essential for clear communication, even though creative deviations are acceptable. 

Overall, your essay is engaging and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. With some improvements in organization and attention to detail in language use, your writing will be even more impactful and enjoyable to read.

STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The features affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the road, the rocks everything close. The cyclist needs to know everything about where he's going, because if not then he can run into some problems along the way, For example like snakes, rough terrain, rocks in the way. That why its important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves. That why when you see cyclist you see them around, a road where theres cars around, just in case they get into trouble.
TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","FEEDBACK:

Thank you for your essay. I can see that you have put thought into how a cyclist needs to be aware of their surroundings. However, there are several areas you could improve:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**: Your essay could benefit from clearer organization. Try to structure your ideas in a more logical order. For instance, first discuss the various features that affect cyclists, then explain the importance of being aware of these features. 

2. **Detail and Examples**: While you mention several factors that can affect a cyclist, such as roads, rocks, and snakes, it would be helpful to expand on these points with more detailed examples or explanations. For instance, explain how rough terrain specifically affects cycling.

3. **Grammar and Punctuation**: There are several grammatical errors and incomplete sentences that need attention. For example, ""For example the road, the rocks everything close."" could be revised to ""For example, the road, the rocks, and everything nearby can affect the cyclist."" Also, ""That why its important"" should be ""That's why it's important.""

4. **Pronoun Consistency**: Be consistent with pronoun usage. You shift between ""he"" and ""they"". Pick one and stick to it throughout the essay to maintain clarity.

5. **Misconceptions**: The line ""That why its important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves"" might be misleading. Cyclists often need to heed advice from experienced cyclists, maps, or even safety instructions. Consider revising this to emphasize the importance of being self-reliant while also staying informed.

6. **Safety and Context**: When you mention that cyclists are often seen on roads with cars, it’s important to clarify the context. Stress the importance of safety and being visible to others on the road, and perhaps mention the value of wearing protective gear like helmets.

Here is a revised version of your essay with these suggestions incorporated:

---

The features of the environment affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the road conditions, nearby rocks, and other environmental factors can significantly impact the ride. A cyclist needs to be fully aware of their surroundings because if they are not, they can encounter problems along the way, such as encountering snakes, navigating rough terrain, or avoiding rocks in their path. 

That's why it's important for a cyclist to be well-prepared and informed about their route. While self-reliance is crucial, cyclists should also take advice from reliable sources and use appropriate tools like maps and safety guidelines. 

When you often see cyclists on roads shared with cars, it is important to remember that this choice is made for visibility and safety. Cyclists need to ensure they are visible to drivers and are following traffic rules to minimize risks. Wearing protective gear, such as helmets and reflective clothing, further enhances their safety on busy roads.

Keep up the good work, and keep refining your writing skills!",0.8907730607922778,0.8756565347406366
28,93,"The essay on how settings affect cyclists falls significantly short of the expectations set forth by the teacher's guidelines. The content is simplistic and lacks originality and depth, failing to provide unique or creative insights into the topic. The thesis statement is not clearly defined, and the supporting arguments are underdeveloped and repetitive. The overall organization is weak, with an abrupt and unengaging introduction, poorly structured body paragraphs, and a conclusion that does not offer a fresh perspective. The essay lacks creativity in its flow of ideas, making it difficult to follow. Additionally, the language and style are monotonous and lack variation, with numerous grammatical errors that detract from readability. There is little to no imaginative vocabulary or sentence structure, and the writing does not demonstrate control of standard writing conventions. Overall, the essay needs significant improvement in clarity, structure, content, and language to meet the desired criteria of originality and creative expression.",93,"The passage you’ve written explores the influence of settings on cyclists’ experiences, which is a compelling topic! Here are some insightful points that can help elevate your essay:

1. **Creative Introduction and Expression:** You’ve chosen a great topic that allows for vivid descriptions and emotional depth. Try starting with a captivating scene to draw readers in. For instance, ""Imagine cycling through a picturesque valley where every turn reveals a new vista, the pain in your muscles momentarily forgotten...""

2. **Developing Ideas with Depth:** Your idea that a beautiful setting can distract from pain is intriguing. To deepen this point, include specific examples or anecdotes. Perhaps describe a scenario where a cyclist overcomes a grueling ride by focusing on a breathtaking landscape.

3. **Language and Word Choice:** While your message is clear, it can be enriched with more varied and imaginative language. Instead of saying ""nice"" or ""not very nice,"" use more descriptive words like ""serene,"" ""picturesque,"" ""bleak,"" or ""monotonous."" This will make your writing more engaging.

4. **Organizational Flow:** Your essay would benefit from clearer transitions and structured paragraphs. For each point you make, start a new paragraph. For example, the impact of a ""nice"" setting can be one paragraph, and the influence of a ""not nice"" setting can be another.

5. **Fluid Sentence Structures:** Some sentences can be restructured for better fluidity. For example, instead of ""also, if the setting isn’t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery,"" you could write, ""Conversely, in an uninspiring environment, cyclists might find their focus shifting more towards their physical discomfort.""

6. **Attention to Detail and Proofreading:** There are minor grammatical errors and repetitions, such as “the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster.” Careful proofreading will help catch these mistakes. Reading your essay aloud can also help you catch any awkward phrasing or repetitive words.

7. **Encouraging Originality and Voice:** Your essay touches on an interesting perspective about the mental and physical aspects of cycling. Push yourself to delve deeper into this perspective—how does the setting influence not just the body but also the spirit of the cyclist? 

Overall, you’re on the right track with your ideas. By enhancing the descriptive language, organizing your thoughts clearly, and paying attention to detail, you’ll create a more compelling and polished piece. Keep nurturing your creative voice and exploring these unique perspectives. Wonderful effort!","

And they dont get to see that of things like go to the @CAPS1, @CAPS2 football,

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates an attempt to discuss the impact of computer usage on individuals, but it lacks clarity and effective organization. The main ideas are present but not fully developed or supported with specific details, making the overall argument somewhat simplistic and broad. The essay's structure is disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a need for a clearer flow of ideas. The language used is repetitive and often inappropriate, with many words misused or misspelled, which detracts significantly from the intended message. Sentence structures are awkward and lack fluidity, causing the reader to frequently pause and reread for comprehension. Additionally, the essay contains numerous grammatical errors, incorrect punctuation, and inconsistent capitalization, which further impede readability. However, there are moments of creative expression, and the writer's point of view is clearly stated, though it requires more refinement and stronger support to be more persuasive and engaging. Improving these areas with a focus on originality and imaginative language use, while maintaining grammatical accuracy, will enhance the overall quality of the essay.

TEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.
FEEDBACK: 
","Dear Student,

Thank you for your effort in writing this essay. Here are some points of feedback to help you improve your writing:

1. **Clarity and Coherence**:
   - The main idea of your essay is clear, but it would benefit from a more structured approach. Consider breaking your ideas into distinct paragraphs, each focusing on a specific aspect of how settings affect cyclists.
   - Ensure that each sentence logically flows from one to the next. This will make your argument more coherent and easier to follow.

2. **Grammar and Punctuation**:
   - Pay attention to capitalization and punctuation. For example, ""also"" should be capitalized at the beginning of a sentence, and ""isn't very nice"" should be separated with a comma.
   - Eliminate any typographical errors like the use of ""&"" instead of ""and"" and ""@MONTH1"" which seems to be a placeholder error.

3. **Word Choice and Sentence Structure**:
   - Varied sentence structure can make your writing more engaging. Try to avoid repetitive phrasing, such as ""the rider... the rider..."".
   - Avoid using words like ""drive"" when referring to cycling; ""ride"" would be more appropriate.

4. **Depth of Analysis**:
   - Provide more detailed examples or explanations to support your points. For instance, explain how a beautiful setting can enhance the cycling experience or provide more details on how a hilly terrain can affect a cyclist's performance.

Here’s a revised version of your paragraph to illustrate these points:

""The settings affect cyclists in a variety of ways. If the setting is pleasant, the rider can focus on the scenery rather than the discomfort they might be experiencing. Conversely, if the surroundings are less appealing, the rider is likely to concentrate more on their pain than their environment. Additionally, a hilly terrain presents a physical challenge, causing the cyclist to exert more effort, which can lead to increased pain and quicker dehydration. Clearly, the setting plays a significant role in a cyclist's overall experience.""

Keep working on refining your writing, and don't hesitate to seek feedback and revise your work. Great job, and keep up the good effort!

29,95,"The essay on Saeng's attempts to adjust to her new home lacks depth and detail, making it difficult to engage with the content fully. The thesis is overly simplistic and not particularly original or thought-provoking, and the supporting arguments are underdeveloped. There is no innovative or creative angle that captures the reader's interest. The organization of the essay is weak, with a brief and unengaging introduction, body paragraphs that lack depth and smooth transitions, and an abrupt conclusion that does not provide a fresh perspective. The language and style are very basic, with a limited range of vocabulary and sentence structures that do not demonstrate creativity or variety. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors and awkward constructions that impede readability. Overall, the essay does not meet the criteria for originality, creative expression, or imaginative language use. To improve, the writer should focus on developing a unique and compelling thesis, providing richer and more creative supporting arguments, and enhancing the organization and flow of ideas. Using more varied and imaginative language and ensuring grammatical accuracy would also significantly enhance the essay's quality.",95,"Your essay captures a central theme of Saeng's journey, which is her struggle to adapt to her new home while longing for her old one. This is an important and relatable aspect of the story. You've identified a key element of the author's intention in highlighting Saeng's resilience and determination to keep trying despite her difficulties. Well done on pinpointing this!

To further elevate your essay, consider delving deeper into Saeng's emotions and experiences. For example, you could use specific instances from the story to illustrate her internal conflict and how she balances her hope for the future with her attachment to the past. This will add depth and provide a more vivid picture of her character.

Additionally, enhancing your vocabulary and sentence structures can make your writing more engaging and expressive. Instead of phrases like ""trying to be ok,"" you could use more descriptive language such as ""struggling to find comfort"" or ""grappling with her sense of belonging."" This will help convey Saeng's emotional journey more powerfully.

Finally, ensure that your essay flows smoothly from one idea to the next. Using transitional phrases can help link your thoughts together more cohesively. For instance, ""Even though Saeng misses her old home deeply, she remains hopeful and plans to try again in the spring, demonstrating her resilience.""

Overall, you have a strong foundation here. By incorporating more specific details, varied language, and smoother transitions, you can further develop your essay into a compelling narrative that showcases your creative voice. Keep nurturing your originality and continue taking risks in your writing—your unique perspective is what makes your work stand out!","

----- FEEDBACK -----
Here are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to discuss the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the story. The ideas are underdeveloped and the content is minimal, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the intended message. There is a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points being made, which weakens the overall argument. The response also tends to wander off-topic and does not adhere closely to the prompt. The language used is simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors, such as ""shes"" instead of ""she's"" and ""sentance"" instead of ""sentence."" These errors distract from the readability of the essay and hinder its effectiveness. Additionally, the essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes the narrative difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing detailed support from the story, maintaining clarity in addressing the prompt, enhancing vocabulary, and ensuring a smooth flow of ideas with proper transitions.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======
STUDENT ESSAY TEXT: he really has a family, that show they care. He appreciates what his parents have done for him. You can tell his very greatful because of the way he expresses himself about his family. ""In reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spint of generosity impressed upon me, and demonstrate of how important family and friends are"". He is a caring young boy.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a genuine effort to explore the theme of family gratitude in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, but it lacks the originality and creative expression that could elevate it. While it includes specific quotations from the memoir, the analysis remains superficial and doesn't delve deeply into the unique aspects of Rodriguez's experiences or emotions. The introduction could be more engaging, and the body paragraphs would benefit from smoother transitions and more innovative development of arguments. The vocabulary and sentence structures are fairly basic, and there are several grammatical errors, such as inconsistencies in the spelling of ""grateful"" and issues with punctuation and capitalization. Additionally, the essay could improve its narrative flow by enhancing the use of transitional words and providing a more conversational tone. Overall, while the essay addresses some of the key points from the memoir, it would benefit from a more creative approach and a deeper analysis to fully capture the essence of Rodriguez's gratitude towards his family.

======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======

And his family. Also Narciso childhood. His neighborhood is made out of cubans, And @CAPS1. That was the memoir of this passage.

TEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a minimal understanding of the content about Narciso Rodriguez's background and experiences. While it mentions his Cuban nationality and pride, as well as his residence in Newark and family dynamics, it lacks specificity and depth in its supporting arguments. The response does not effectively utilize evidence from the memoir to strengthen its points, leading to a surface-level engagement with the topic. In terms of language, the essay demonstrates adequate grammar and spelling, with some minor errors and a limited range of vocabulary. The structure is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of cohesive flow between ideas, making it challenging to follow the narrative smoothly. Enhancing the originality and creativity in the development of the thesis, supporting arguments, and conclusion would greatly improve the overall quality of the essay. Additionally, incorporating a more engaging introduction and imaginative use of language and sentence structures would elevate the essay's appeal.

2. **Structure and Organization:**
   - The essay would be more effective if it followed a more structured format. Consider breaking it into paragraphs with clear topic sentences. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea or aspect of Rodriguez's memoir.
