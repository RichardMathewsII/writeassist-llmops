This involves not only teaching them to craft precise and robust thesis statements but also guiding them in structuring their essays logically with clear transitions and well-defined topic sentences. Furthermore, I aim to ensure that students support their arguments with substantial evidence and logically sound reasoning.\n\nIt is also crucial that students demonstrate technical precision and linguistic correctness in their writing. This includes the appropriate use of technical terminology, complex yet clear sentence structures, and a keen attention to grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization.\n\nUltimately, my goal is to equip students with the skills necessary to communicate their ideas effectively and persuasively, both in writing and in broader academic pursuits. This foundation will serve them well in advanced studies and in any professional field where clear and compelling communication is valued."

                "response": "As a teacher, my overall teaching style is characterized by a strong emphasis on evidence-based arguments and logical reasoning. When providing feedback and interacting with students, I focus on several key aspects to ensure their academic success and intellectual development.\n\nIn terms of content, I prioritize the clarity and precision of students' thesis statements, the robust support of arguments with substantial evidence and logical reasoning, and the effectiveness of their conclusions. My feedback in this area often involves pointing out where arguments could be more clearly articulated, where additional data or factual support is needed, and how conclusions can better synthesize the information presented.\n\nRegarding organization, I value a clear and logical structure in students' work. My feedback frequently addresses the coherence of their transitions, the clarity of their topic sentences, and the overall flow of their ideas. I provide specific suggestions on how to rearrange sections or rephrase parts of their work to improve readability and logical progression.\n\nIn the language and style category, I emphasize the appropriateness and precision of technical terminology and the complexity and clarity of sentence structures. I encourage students to use precise vocabulary and to construct sentences that, while complex, remain clear and unambiguous. My feedback often includes recommendations for vocabulary enhancement and sentence restructuring to achieve these goals.\n\nFinally, in the conventions category, I meticulously check for grammatical accuracy, correct spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. I provide detailed corrections and explain the rationale behind them to help students understand and avoid similar errors in the future.\n\nOverall, I believe in a comprehensive approach to feedback, addressing content, organization, language, style, and conventions. I strive to create a supportive and intellectually stimulating environment where students feel encouraged to think critically, write clearly and logically, and constantly refine their academic skills. This holistic approach helps students not only excel in their current assignments but also develop the skills necessary for future academic and professional success."

For example, it says \u0093and ther growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a georgus day in June\u0094. Also , he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says \u0093I  was doing a water depleting 12 mph. sometimes life could be so creul\u0094. in conclusion, this cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay on the cyclist\u2019s experience conveys the main idea but lacks depth and detail. The thesis is somewhat clear, but the arguments supporting it are not sufficiently developed with concrete evidence or logical reasoning. The brief quotes provided from the source text are relevant but are not adequately integrated into the essay to enhance the argument. Additionally, the essay needs a more robust conclusion that synthesizes the points discussed. The organization is basic, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, but it lacks coherent transitions and well-defined topic sentences, which makes the flow of ideas somewhat choppy. The language used is simplistic and contains several grammatical errors, such as punctuation mistakes and improper use of capitalization, which detract from the overall readability and effectiveness. To improve, the essay should incorporate more substantial evidence from the text, use precise and varied vocabulary, and ensure grammatical accuracy to enhance clarity and impact.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: What Saeng means at the end of the paragraph is that where it is a seasson for those plants she will take the test again. The test to begin to like like the plot. Like features and characters about. Also the history about these plants. \n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is significantly lacking in clarity, structure, and content coherence. The central idea of what Saeng means at the end of the paragraph is not clear, and the arguments presented are vague and unsupported by any substantial evidence or logical reasoning. The essay is exceptionally brief and does not offer a concrete thesis or any developed arguments. The sentences are fragmented, and there is a noticeable absence of transitional phrases and logical progression, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. Additionally, the vocabulary is not used effectively, and the language is simplistic and imprecise. Grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, and spelling mistakes further impede the readability of the essay. Overall, the essay does not meet the expectations for a well-reasoned, evidence-based argument and falls short in all evaluated categories. It is crucial to develop a clear thesis, provide detailed and logical support for arguments, ensure smooth transitions, and maintain grammatical accuracy for future submissions.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The @CAPS1 created by the @CAPS2 in @CAPS3 like in @CAPS4 @NUM1 it sAys that My Mother And My fAther hAd to come to this country with Such courAge, without Any knowledge of the lAnguAge or the culture they cAme selflessly, As MAny immigrants do, to give their children A better life, even though it Meant leaving behind their families, friends, And careers in the country they loved.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a vivid and heartfelt narrative about the author's family and their experiences as Cuban immigrants in the United States. However, it does not fully address the requirements of the rubric. The introductory paragraph contains redacted information, making it difficult to understand its relevance and context. The essay does not present a clear thesis statement, which limits its coherence and focus. Additionally, while the narrative is engaging and filled with rich detail, it lacks a logical progression and clear support of arguments with evidence. The conclusion, though emotionally resonant, does not effectively synthesize the arguments presented. The organization of the essay is somewhat fragmented, with transitions that could be more coherent and topic sentences that are not always clear. Language and style are generally appropriate, but there are several grammatical errors, particularly with capitalization, which detract from the overall readability. To improve, the essay should focus on providing a clear thesis, structured arguments supported by specific evidence, and a conclusion that ties everything together effectively. Additionally, attention to grammatical accuracy and logical flow would enhance readability and coherence.\n---------------------------\n\nYour updated profile should maintain the format of the existing teacher persona.\n"

What the @CAPS1 \u0093In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.\u0094 It means she\u0092ll try the @CAPS2 Test again try new test to make her like wheres she\u0092s at and what she can @CAPS3 from it.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay suffers from several issues that impact its clarity, structure, and overall content. First and foremost, the central thesis is unclear and lacks emotional resonance. The attempt to discuss Saeng\u2019s journey and her ability to overcome challenges is evident but not effectively communicated. The use of incomplete sentences and multiple redacted references (\"@CAPS1,\" \"@CAPS2,\" etc.) disrupts the flow of the narrative, making it difficult for the reader to follow. Additionally, the personal anecdotes and emotional appeals, which are crucial for high-scoring essays in this rubric, are almost entirely absent. The emotional journey that Saeng undergoes is not well-developed or supported with specific examples from the text. The conclusion, rather than summarizing the emotional journey effectively, leaves the reader confused about the essay's main points. In terms of organization, the transitions between ideas are abrupt and do not contribute to a logical flow that enhances emotional impact. Language and style are also problematic; the vocabulary is neither varied nor emotionally expressive, and the sentence structures are awkward and repetitive. Finally, the essay has numerous grammatical errors, misspellings, and issues with punctuation, which hinder readability and distract the reader from the intended message. Overall, this essay requires substantial revision to meet the criteria for high scores in emotional resonance, clarity, and organization.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The setting desented in the story, \u0093Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,\u0094 would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer\u0092s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, \u0093wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke\u0094 (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the setting and its effect on the cyclist but lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The inclusion of specific examples, such as the intense heat and dehydration the cyclist experienced, provides some support to the points made. However, the response often strays from a clear focus on the emotional and physical impact of the setting on the cyclist. The language used is somewhat repetitive and lacks variety, making the reading experience less engaging. Additionally, there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as \"desented\" instead of \"deserted\" and \"sorroundings\" instead of \"surroundings,\" which detract from the overall readability. While the narrative does include some transitional phrases, the flow is disjointed, and the essay fails to maintain a strong emotional connection with the reader. Further development of the central idea and emotional resonance would improve the essay significantly.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is said in all different ways. In paragraph @NUM1 when she talks about her love for cooking the mood is calm with a dash of spice to it. Since she is Cuban I like to think the cooking is spicy. In paragraph @NUM2 she states, \"My parents always kept their arms and doors open to many people we considered family...\" That is a happy loving mood. To be able to say that means you have some pretty amazing neighbors. In paragraph @NUM3, \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" That is the most important mood set in this memoir because she is thanking her parents for her life that she has. That is a very respectful thing to do. Everyone does it, but did you write a memoir about it?\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez: From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives\" and attempts to address the emotional and expressive aspects as outlined by the guidelines. However, the clarity and emotional impact of the thesis are somewhat lacking, as the main argument is not clearly stated or emotionally compelling. The essay makes use of personal anecdotes from the memoir to support its points, but these points are not thoroughly developed and lack depth. The conclusion attempts to summarize the emotional journey but falls short of effectively capturing the essence of the memoir\u2019s emotional impact.\n\nThe organization of the essay is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions between paragraphs that hinder the flow of ideas. While it starts with an engaging introduction, the body paragraphs are not well-structured and lack smooth transitions, making it difficult to follow the narrative. The language used is basic, with limited variety in word choice and sentence structure, which reduces the emotional expressiveness of the essay. There are also several grammatical errors, including misspellings such as \"greatful\" instead of \"grateful,\" which detract from the overall quality of the writing.\n\nTo improve, the essay should focus on crafting a clearer, more emotionally resonant thesis statement and developing the supporting arguments with richer personal anecdotes and emotional appeals. Additionally, improving the organization with better-structured paragraphs and smoother transitions will enhance the logical flow of ideas. Finally, using more varied and expressive vocabulary and sentence structures, while minimizing grammatical errors, will significantly elevate the emotional impact and overall quality of the essay.\n---------------------------\n\nYour updated profile should maintain the format of the existing teacher persona.\n"

The overall message is somewhat muddled due to confusing syntax and word choice, which detracts from the intended emphasis on the author's memories of her homeland. The paragraph could benefit from more precise language and a clearer connection between the memories evoked by the spring season and the author's decision to retake her driving test. Additionally, the development of the argument lacks coherence, with details about animals and blossoming trees feeling tangential and underdeveloped. The organization is also weak, as transitions between sentences are abrupt, making the narrative hard to follow. Furthermore, grammatical errors such as \"memoreies,\" \"beautifu,\" and several awkward phrasings, impede readability and distract from the content. To improve, the essay should focus on refining sentence structures, ensuring grammatical accuracy, and creating a more logical flow of ideas to effectively convey the emotional significance of the author's memories.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Due to the features in the setting, including the hot summer weather, the cyclist not knowing the area, and the California desert the cyclist is affected.

Also the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, \u0093\u0085The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June\u0094(Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the heat of the desert is taking a toll on him.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay requires significant improvement in multiple areas to meet the outlined guidelines. The thesis statement is present but lacks clarity and grammatical precision, making it difficult to grasp the main idea. The development and support of arguments are hindered by numerous grammatical errors, such as \"hes\" instead of \"he's\" and \"reguarly\" instead of \"regularly.\" These errors detract from the essay's overall effectiveness. The organization is weak, with transitions and topic sentences that do not sufficiently guide the reader through the argument. The essay lacks a clear structure, making the flow of ideas disjointed. Additionally, the word choice is basic and repetitive, failing to convey the intended message with precision and variety. Sentence structures are simplistic and awkward at times, further impeding readability. While the essay addresses the prompt to some extent, the supporting evidence is sparse and not well-integrated. Overall, the essay needs considerable revision in terms of grammatical accuracy, organization, content development, and language use to achieve a higher score.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear @LOCATION1, I understand this focus situation, the effect of computers or our society people's reactions are less than about them & my question to is who?

The help to thing happen but if done on real life could faster of they also help to electronically than a. So now, after this letter you go out i publish this telling every good effects of computers. Again I thank you for reading this letter.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay you provided has a clear understanding of the main ideas regarding the positive effects of computers on society. However, it struggles significantly with clarity, grammatical accuracy, and logical organization. The thesis is somewhat identifiable but is muddled by numerous grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures. The arguments presented in support of the thesis lack coherence and are difficult to follow due to the disjointed sentences and unclear transitions. The conclusion attempts to summarize the essay's points but fails to do so effectively because of the same issues. The paragraphs are not clearly delineated, making it hard to discern the structure of the essay. Additionally, the language used is often incorrect and repetitive, with many sentences being awkward or incomplete, which impedes readability. There are numerous errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization throughout the text. To improve, the essay needs a thorough revision to enhance grammatical precision, logical organization, and clarity of expression.\n---------------------------\n\nYour updated profile should maintain the format of the existing teacher persona.\n"

A good library is diverse and has something that everyone of different backgrounds can enjoy.                 A compromise wouldn't be as difficult as some people might actually think.  Simply regulating books, and other products, by creating age limits based on the books content and maturity level would be an excellent alternative to actually censoring the books themselves.  Take an author like @PERSON1 for example.  His books contain subject matter and offensive crude language that would obviously not be deemed acceptable for most younger people.  That being said censoring the books language wouldn't help in the slightest. If a younger person has the mental capability to read a book like @PERSON1 then they would have no problem making inferences on what matierial was said, and the ideas in the writing are going to be realized.                  The other fact is that taking out mature level books completley from the libraries is not a possible solution either. If you take out the diversity in your product your going to lose the diversity in your customer's as well. For instance think about a movie store. If the only movies sold were @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 there would be a lot less people wanting to go to that store, because then it just turns into a child's store. Even censoring the movies would not be effective because your taking away the art of having an unfiltered movie.                   So my simple solution is obvious. Movies have ratings based on maturity content, so why shouldn't books. Books that deal with more controversal content shouldn't be placed in the shelves next to young readers' books, and they should have a label indicating that the specific book @MONTH1 contain material not suitable for a person under a specific age. People trying to censor entertainment and look into the best interest of their loved ones is perfectly fine, but you cant blindfold them forever. Were all on the same planet and we all reach the age of realization of reality.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and focused argument against censorship in libraries, using vivid examples and logical reasoning to support its points. The content is rich with specific details and examples, such as the comparison between book censorship and movie ratings, which effectively illustrate the writer's perspective. The organization, while coherent, could benefit from stronger transitions between paragraphs to enhance the overall flow and make the structure more engaging. The word choice is varied and suitable, effectively conveying the intended message with an appropriate level of precision. Sentence fluency is generally smooth, with a good mix of sentence structures that keep the reader engaged. However, some minor grammatical and spelling errors are present, which occasionally impede readability. Overall, the essay demonstrates a strong command of conventions, though attention to detail in proofreading would further improve its clarity and impact.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: According to @PERSON1, economic @CAPS1, every hour you spend on the computer, you raise your electricity bill by @MONEY2. The average @CAPS2 spends @NUM1 hours on the computer everyday. I believe that spending too much time on the computer could be a bad thing. You have economic loss from the electric bill, health loss because you won't be able to exercise as much, and community less because you won't spen as much with your community. Financial loss is something that many people are concerned about. If everybody spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, they could save @MONEY1 off their electric bill. In a survey, @NUM3 out @MONEY1 @NUM4 people said they would do anything to save money. So if they spent less time on the computer they would save lots @MONEY1 money. In addition to financial loss there is also a health issue. Many people are talking about how americans are becoming obise. Part @MONEY1 this is due to spending too much time on the computer. Proffesor @CAPS3 @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 says that, \"the obisety in @LOCATION1 is a problem, if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, that problem would be solved.\" @CAPS4, @NUM5 out @MONEY1 @NUM6 people are obese. If everyone spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, it would become @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM6. Although health is a problem community is a bigger one. People never talk to eachother face to face anymore. They all talk on @CAPS5 or @CAPS6. Commmunities are spending less time together in real life than on the computer. @PERSON1, expert on human behavior, says that when people spend less time on the computer, ther spend more time together. It's a fact that when people spend more time together, they have more fun. So, I would say that spending less time on the computer would be beneficial to our community. It would provides financial, health, and community benefits. These are all important things that we lack if we spend too much time on the commputer.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and focused argument against excessive computer use, supported by recognizable main ideas: financial loss, health issues, and community disintegration. The originality of the thesis could be improved by providing a more unique or thought-provoking perspective on the topic. The essay is satisfactorily organized, with a basic introduction, body, and conclusion, though the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow of ideas. The word choice effectively conveys the intended message, but there is room for more varied and imaginative language to make the essay more engaging. The sentences generally flow well, though some constructions could be more fluid and varied to maintain the reader\u2019s interest. The essay demonstrates control of standard writing conventions, but there are noticeable errors in spelling and grammar that slightly impede readability. Overall, the essay is clear and persuasive but could benefit from more creative expression and polished language use to fully align with the teacher's emphasis on originality and creative expression.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I think all books and other stuff should stay on the shelfs. Because other people should have the right to learn about something if you have already learned it.  Censorship is kind of out of the way.  I think it really doesnt matter if they see it now or later because they are still going to see it and learn about it later on in life. If someone wants to read it I think they have right to because it is their own choice.  I have been observing students and adults in the libaries and every where they think they can run everything.  But this is what I think is right\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay on censorship in libraries reflects a sincere and personal viewpoint, but it lacks depth in the development of arguments and originality in its thesis statement. The ideas are somewhat unclear and not fully fleshed out, making it difficult to engage the reader effectively. The structure of the essay is disjointed, with abrupt transitions between thoughts and an overall lack of coherence, which hinders the flow of the argument. The vocabulary used is basic and repetitive, failing to bring any creative flair or precision to the writing. Sentence structures are often simplistic and occasionally awkward, which impacts the readability and fluidity of the text. While there are attempts at conveying ideas, grammatical errors and inconsistent use of conventions further detract from the essay's overall impact. To improve, the essay would benefit from a stronger and more innovative thesis, better-organized content with clear transitions, more varied and imaginative language, and careful proofreading to minimize errors.\n---------------------------\n\nYour updated profile should maintain the format of the existing teacher persona.\n"

The thesis statement is almost non-existent, and there is a lack of coherent development and support for any argument. The single sentence provided does not adequately introduce or conclude the topic, nor does it present a clear opinion or argument regarding the effects computers have on people or censorship in libraries. There are no real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning to support the writer\u2019s stance, which significantly weakens the content. Additionally, the sentence structure is awkward, with grammatical errors that hinder readability. The absence of transitional phrases and logical flow makes the essay difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on developing a clear thesis, supporting arguments with concrete examples, and ensuring grammatical accuracy while maintaining a structured and coherent narrative.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Rolling hills, open terran, hgh deserts-all are features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic response to the prompt by discussing how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, focusing on rolling hills, open terrain, and high deserts. However, it lacks depth and specificity in its supporting details, which limits the clarity and persuasiveness of the arguments. The writer uses some real-world examples but does not fully develop them to support their points effectively. The narrative follows a logical sequence, but transitions between ideas are somewhat abrupt, making the flow less smooth. While the language is generally clear and functional, it shows occasional errors in spelling and grammar, such as \"terran,\" \"hgh,\" and \"mles,\" which detract from the overall readability. Improving the essay would involve elaborating on the points with more detailed and specific examples, enhancing the transitions between ideas for better coherence, and carefully proofreading to correct grammatical errors.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Hello I am kristin, I am here to tell you why we should take some magazines out of our public libraries. Now I dont know if you have heard about @CAPS1 the magazine or @CAPS2 magazine. But I have and I also use to read them. In some of thouse issues are sex tips.           Now if I was a mother and my child ran up to me beging me to let them cheek that thing out I would look at them and say no. They dont need to undestand sex untill they are in there teens or atleast thirteen or fourteen. A child shouldnt be able to even go near that area they should only be able to go near the children's section.           Some parents think like me and agree with the fact that a child shouldn't learn about sex. But others are like why not they are going to know about it in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and when they are married also.           There are also some other things that need out of a librarie. Some music might not be the best choice for a young child. Like for example rap music. It has allot of cussing in it and talking about sex. Some of the things said in a rap song are shorty let me rind you like a huricain. Thats just like saying hey chick lets do it for the heck of it. Thats not what I want my kid to listen to. I want my child to listen to stuff that says hey lets go outside and camp or duck duck gusse.              Some movies are okay to watch with your kids as long as its not over @NUM1. But if it is they can't watch it. I'll give you another example my little neice is probubly around the age of ten or so. She watche's @CAPS5 @CAPS6 but only with her parents inthe same room as her. She can not watch it by herself or she will get grounded.      This is why some of the stuff should be taken out of our public Libraries\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay on why certain materials should be removed from public libraries demonstrates a clear central argument but suffers from a lack of depth and precision in its development. The thesis is present, though not explicitly stated, and the examples provided, such as magazines with sex tips and rap music, are somewhat relevant but not sufficiently detailed or supported by concrete evidence. The essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a somewhat disorganized manner, making it difficult for the reader to follow the author's line of reasoning. Additionally, the transitions between paragraphs are abrupt, and the topic sentences are not well-defined, leading to a disjointed flow of ideas. Word choice is generally appropriate but lacks variety and precision, with some colloquial phrases and grammatical errors detracting from the overall quality of the writing. Sentence structures are often repetitive and awkward, impeding the natural flow and readability of the text. Finally, the essay contains numerous errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which distract the reader and undermine the clarity of the argument. To improve, the essay needs a more precise thesis, better organization, detailed support with real-world examples, varied and appropriate word choice, and careful attention to grammatical conventions.\n---------------------------\n\nYour updated profile should maintain the format of the existing teacher persona.\n"
