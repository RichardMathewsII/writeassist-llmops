When providing feedback and interacting with students, I focus on several key aspects to ensure their academic success and intellectual development.\n\nIn terms of content, I prioritize the clarity and precision of students' thesis statements, the robust support of arguments with substantial evidence and logical reasoning, and the effectiveness of their conclusions. My feedback in this area often involves pointing out where arguments could be more clearly articulated, where additional data or factual support is needed, and how conclusions can better synthesize the information presented.\n\nRegarding organization, I value a clear and logical structure in students' work. My feedback frequently addresses the coherence of their transitions, the clarity of their topic sentences, and the overall flow of their ideas. I provide specific suggestions on how to rearrange sections or rephrase parts of their work to improve readability and logical progression.\n\nIn the language and style category, I emphasize the appropriateness and precision of technical terminology and the complexity and clarity of sentence structures. I encourage students to use precise vocabulary and to construct sentences that, while complex, remain clear and unambiguous. My feedback often includes recommendations for vocabulary enhancement and sentence restructuring to achieve these goals.\n\nFinally, in the conventions category, I meticulously check for grammatical accuracy, correct spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. I provide detailed corrections and explain the rationale behind them to help students understand and avoid similar errors in the future.\n\nOverall, I believe in a comprehensive approach to feedback, addressing content, organization, language, style, and conventions. I strive to create a supportive and intellectually stimulating environment where students feel encouraged to think critically, write clearly and logically, and constantly refine their academic skills. This holistic approach helps students not only excel in their current assignments but also develop the skills necessary for future academic and professional success."

They had to dismiss many hardships such as lack of water, being lost, immense desert heat, plus minor things like snakes and road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June was the most intense hardship. That and the lack of water. Though the heat starting powing at the cyclists\u0092 brain by making them see mirages, etc. The heat and entire setting made the cyclists\u0092 travel much harder.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a general overview of the cyclist's hardships during their journey through the California desert, mentioning issues such as extreme heat, lack of water, and challenging terrain. While the central idea is identifiable, it lacks depth and specificity, requiring more substantial evidence and detailed examples to bolster the main points. The essay's organization is somewhat disjointed, with ideas not fully fleshed out or logically connected, leading to a lack of smooth narrative flow. Transitional phrases and topic sentences are sparse, which hampers the coherence and fluidity of the text. Furthermore, the language used is basic and occasionally imprecise, with some grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures that detract from the overall readability. Enhancing the clarity of arguments, providing more detailed examples, and polishing the language would significantly improve the effectiveness of the essay.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 people use computers but not every one agress that it benefits society. In my opinion, computers benefit society. There are @CAPS1 websites that can help you find information. Computers also allow people to work easily. A third reason is @CAPS1 companies are able to use them to gain business. If you are doing a project or need to look up information about something, the internet is one of the easiest ways to find that information. Google.com has so much information about almost any topic you can think of. If you are a teenager that doesn't have a drivers license and there is no one to take you to the library, computers allow you to be able to hand in the report/project on time. There are also websites that find you direction, to where you need to go. Mapquest.com is a quick and easy way to help you figure out which way to go. Computers allow people to easily. If your family member lives far away and you don't have enough money for the phone bill, computers help you to not loose touch. There are websites that can help you keep in contact with old friends that you don't see anymore. Computers are one of the only ways that people fighting in the wars can talk to their relatives. They are not able to have phones and sending a letter can take a long time. Companies use computers for easy access to the public. If you are a new company, you can put a little ad on the sicle of the screen on yahoo.com and millions of people will see it. They of so use computers to make flyers easily and quickly. Making a hundred flyers by hand can take hours. But on the computers all you have to do is make one and then you can print out one-hundred. Using computers helps society. you can easily find what you are looking for and you are able talk to anyone you want. Also, it is easy for companies to attract business. Those are only a few of the @CAPS1 reasons why computers are good for society.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: This essay presents a clear stance on the benefits of computers to society and supports the thesis with relevant examples and logical reasoning. However, the thesis could be more precise to provide a stronger foundation for the argument. The essay is well-organized, with clear transitions between points, although the topic sentences could be more defined to enhance readability. The use of language is mostly effective, but there are moments where vocabulary could be more varied and precise to convey the intended message more powerfully. Sentence structures are generally clear and varied, contributing to a smooth flow of ideas. On the other hand, the essay has several minor grammatical errors and some issues with capitalization, which slightly impede the overall readability. Strengthening the thesis statement, refining topic sentences, and correcting grammatical errors would further enhance the clarity, structure, and content of this essay.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful. The author proved that it doesn't take the amount of money, or how big your house is to be happy. Sometimes its just the simple things. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, \"my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" The author is showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood, they still treat each other as if they were. In the last sentence of the memoir it reads, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" This shows the reader that no house is a home without happy memories and great lessons learned.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a general understanding of the memoir's themes, but it lacks a precise and clear thesis statement, resulting in an overall vague argument. While there are some references to specific passages in the memoir, they are not well integrated into the argument, and the connection between the evidence and the points being made is not sufficiently established. The structure of the essay is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of coherent flow from one idea to the next. Additionally, the use of language is basic, with limited vocabulary and several grammatical errors that detract from the overall readability and effectiveness of the essay. The narrative struggles to hold the reader's interest due to its repetitive nature and lack of engaging storytelling techniques. To improve, the essay should focus on developing a clear thesis, integrating evidence seamlessly into the argument, enhancing the logical flow with better transitions, and refining language use to be more varied and precise.\n---------------------------\n\nYour updated profile should maintain the format of the existing teacher persona.\n"

This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer\u0092s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, \u0093wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke\u0094 (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the setting and its effect on the cyclist but lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The inclusion of specific examples, such as the intense heat and dehydration the cyclist experienced, provides some support to the points made. However, the response often strays from a clear focus on the emotional and physical impact of the setting on the cyclist. The language used is somewhat repetitive and lacks variety, making the reading experience less engaging. Additionally, there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as \"desented\" instead of \"deserted\" and \"sorroundings\" instead of \"surroundings,\" which detract from the overall readability. While the narrative does include some transitional phrases, the flow is disjointed, and the essay fails to maintain a strong emotional connection with the reader. Further development of the central idea and emotional resonance would improve the essay significantly.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: In the excerpt, the author created a relaxed tone in the memoir. \"Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen\". This shows how equipped his parents were with Cuban culture. Culture was a big piece of Narciso Rodriguez child hood and life. \"Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home\". This shows that the author is trying to focus your attention on the culture of the @CAPS1 and that the house was relaxed and calm which is the tone of the author.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay delves into the emotional and cultural elements of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, effectively highlighting the significance of Cuban culture and familial bonds. However, the clarity of your thesis statement could be enhanced to better convey the emotional impact and central theme of your analysis. While you include some personal stories and quotes from the memoir, the arguments would benefit from more in-depth development and additional supporting evidence to make a stronger emotional appeal. The organizational structure is somewhat present, but the transitions between paragraphs need to be smoother to ensure a logical flow that enhances the emotional impact. In terms of language and style, your essay shows some variety in vocabulary and sentence structures, but there are areas where word choice and expressiveness could be improved to better capture the emotional nuances of the memoir. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall readability and impact of your writing. To improve, focus on creating a more emotionally resonant thesis, developing your arguments with richer anecdotes and emotional appeals, and refining your language for greater expressiveness and grammatical accuracy.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator is ready. The narrator tried the test once and failed. She bought herself a flower to cheer herself up. Her mother talked to her and then she felt better. She felt determined to pass the driving test just like the flower was determined to survive.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic recounting of the narrator's journey with the driving test and includes some emotional elements, such as the narrator's initial failure and their interaction with their mother. However, it falls short in terms of depth and emotional resonance. The essay lacks specific personal anecdotes and vivid emotional appeals that would make the narrative more engaging and impactful. The connection between the flower and the narrator's determination is not fully fleshed out, leaving the reader wanting more insight into the narrator's feelings and motivations. Additionally, the structure of the essay is quite simplistic, with a series of events listed without much coherence or fluid transitions, which detracts from the overall flow. The language used is basic and does not capture the emotional intensity or expressiveness expected in a high-scoring essay. While there are minimal grammatical errors, the vocabulary is limited and repetitive, which affects the overall readability and engagement. To improve, the essay should include more detailed personal stories, stronger emotional appeals, and varied, expressive language to create a more compelling narrative.\n---------------------------\n\nYour updated profile should maintain the format of the existing teacher persona.\n"

He was, \u0093trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state.\u0094 From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into \u0093A far like substance\u0094 The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay on the influence of the setting in \"Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit\" struggles significantly with clarity, coherence, and adherence to grammatical conventions. The thesis statement is vague and not clearly defined. The essay attempts to discuss how the setting affects the cyclist but lacks specific examples and detailed support from the text, resulting in a superficial response. Many sentences are grammatically incorrect or fragmented, which makes the narrative disjointed and difficult to follow. The organization is weak, with an unclear structure that lacks smooth transitions between ideas. There are numerous spelling and punctuation errors, which further impede readability. Overall, the essay fails to effectively communicate its points due to insufficient content development and weak language control. There is a need for a more structured approach, including a clear thesis, well-supported arguments, and a focus on grammatical accuracy to enhance the overall quality of the writing.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Do I belive that some books, movies, magazines, or ext., shuold be removed do to the fuct some people might find them offensive? NO, I belive that every should have the chance to see it to other then the just the people how did and thought it was offensive. Someone could really like it or a group of people could.Even if some people find an object offensive someone else might need that object for something like school work.     Lets say the libraries remove a human trafficking book from the libraries becuase people find it offensive. Then a local school has a praject on human trafficking. The students go to the libraries to get some books on it. Now do to somebody elses dislike of the books these kids don't get to use those books to do thier reshearch.     It wouldn't be fair to everyone to remove objects from the libraries just cause some other people find it offensive. The libraries is a public place that everyone has the right to go and borrow stuff from. So no i don't belive that libraries should remove books, movies, magazines, or ext., do to the fact that some other people @MONTH1 find them offensive.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay you have written addresses the topic of censorship in libraries and argues that books, movies, magazines, and other materials should not be removed simply because they are found offensive by some individuals. Your main idea is clear, but the essay lacks sufficient supporting details and examples, which makes the argument less compelling. The organization of your essay could be improved, as it transitions abruptly between ideas and lacks a clear, logical flow. For instance, the paragraphs could be better structured to support your thesis effectively. The word choice is often imprecise and informal, such as \"ext.\" instead of \"etc.\" and \"do to\" instead of \"due to.\" Additionally, there are several grammatical errors, including issues with sentence structure, spelling, and punctuation, which detract from the readability and overall impact of the essay. To enhance clarity and effectiveness, ensure that each sentence is grammatically correct and that transitions between paragraphs are smooth. Lastly, refining your vocabulary and sentence structures will help to articulate your arguments more convincingly and maintain the reader's interest throughout.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Picture this: you come home one day after work and before you even enter the house, you hear music blaring from your child's room. As you step closer, you begin to hear the lyrics that go with the banging bass and you realize that that isn't just any music, it's completely unedited, expicit versions of vulgar songs. Now, who would want their child listening to songs that make it seem like drinking, doing drugs, and other various risky activities are okay? I know I sure wouldn't.     Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society. It can be found nearly anywhere. In books, magazines, @CAPS1 shows, movies, on the @CAPS2, you name it. All of these are easily accessible by children of all ages. That is why there should be censorship of certain materials, to a certain degree. By this, I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library, it should only be able to be rented by people who are of a certain age. Just because it's bad doesn't mean that it has to completely vanish from the face of the world. There should just be a limitation on who can view it. That applies to everything that could contain offensive material.      Kids are kids. There are certain things that should be absolutely off limits to them--such as explicit movies, books, music, etc.--as they do not need to know about drugs, sex, or alcohol at such a young age. Censorship should definitely be in effect in places like public libraries where young children are bound to be. But, as mentioned earlier, censorship should only be to a certain degree. Keeping childrens' minds clean for as long as possible would be a very positive thing to do for both them and our society in general\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay provides a compelling argument for the necessity of censorship to protect children from inappropriate content. The thesis is clear and grammatically correct, establishing a strong foundation for your viewpoint. The development of your argument is consistent, using grammatically precise sentences to emphasize the dangers of exposing young children to explicit material. The conclusion effectively reinforces the thesis, summarizing the key points made throughout the essay. The organization of the essay is commendable, with each paragraph logically flowing into the next, guided by clear and grammatically correct transitions and topic sentences. Your word choice is varied and appropriate, enhancing the persuasiveness of your argument. The complexity and correctness of your sentence structures further contribute to the overall readability and impact of the essay. Additionally, the essay demonstrates strong control of standard writing conventions, with minimal errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Overall, your writing is clear, focused, and engaging, adhering to grammatical conventions and displaying a logical and effective organization.\n---------------------------\n\nYour updated profile should maintain the format of the existing teacher persona.\n"

Because other people should have the right to learn about something if you have already learned it.  Censorship is kind of out of the way.  I think it really doesnt matter if they see it now or later because they are still going to see it and learn about it later on in life. If someone wants to read it I think they have right to because it is their own choice.  I have been observing students and adults in the libaries and every where they think they can run everything.  But this is what I think is right\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay on censorship in libraries reflects a sincere and personal viewpoint, but it lacks depth in the development of arguments and originality in its thesis statement. The ideas are somewhat unclear and not fully fleshed out, making it difficult to engage the reader effectively. The structure of the essay is disjointed, with abrupt transitions between thoughts and an overall lack of coherence, which hinders the flow of the argument. The vocabulary used is basic and repetitive, failing to bring any creative flair or precision to the writing. Sentence structures are often simplistic and occasionally awkward, which impacts the readability and fluidity of the text. While there are attempts at conveying ideas, grammatical errors and inconsistent use of conventions further detract from the essay's overall impact. To improve, the essay would benefit from a stronger and more innovative thesis, better-organized content with clear transitions, more varied and imaginative language, and careful proofreading to minimize errors.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I think computers work @CAPS4 because it helps people with there own work. but computers do make people addicted because you mostly could do anything but mostly computers were able to use for help like work, maps, friend to find ot problems like for school it helps htem with math, science, social studies and @CAPS4 of more things. But people abuse it like ther @CAPS2 games and their dont even go outside they don't talk to there friends or even see ther friends its mostly not haven a life. And people dont feel like going to school because their over and there tired and ther just want to use the computer all day with not stopping. And so i think that people are just to addicted to compulers they dont use it for the fright reasons. Had then people get sick they could get hoadaks or they feel like puking. And they dont get to see that of things like go to the @CAPS1, @CAPS2 football, soccer, @CAPS3, valleyball or even take there own dog for a walk at the @CAPS1. @CAPS4 of people buy computers for games and @CAPS4 or muture people buy computer for there work and find were places are so the computer helps @CAPS4 but it addicted @CAPS4 of people. And computers do really break @CAPS4 because people could download a game or something and then it gives it virus. So you mostly spend about @NUM1 $ or @NUM2$ as fix it. And there new computers come and its like @NUM3$ and @NUM4$ and there different just from beand and ther go aboutmore faster. And whne people's computer break some go crazy and feel like doing some cordy stuff. Ther does feel like they does friends they only stay at the room for every they never down out at all and if they do come out the room they instly dont respect there parents they do whatever they feel like doing and they they act into troubles with the . So computers do help out sometimes they dont but maybe should make different changes.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates an attempt to discuss the impact of computer usage on individuals, but it lacks clarity and effective organization. The main ideas are present but not fully developed or supported with specific details, making the overall argument somewhat simplistic and broad. The essay's structure is disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a need for a clearer flow of ideas. The language used is repetitive and often inappropriate, with many words misused or misspelled, which detracts significantly from the intended message. Sentence structures are awkward and lack fluidity, causing the reader to frequently pause and reread for comprehension. Additionally, the essay contains numerous grammatical errors, incorrect punctuation, and inconsistent capitalization, which further impede readability. However, there are moments of creative expression, and the writer's point of view is clearly stated, though it requires more refinement and stronger support to be more persuasive and engaging. Improving these areas with a focus on originality and imaginative language use, while maintaining grammatical accuracy, will enhance the overall quality of the essay.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: If something offensive is found at the library, should it be taken off of the shelves? Some people might look at this question and instantly say yes. Others might not think anything of the item and move along. I disagree with those who believe the item should be remove. Instead, I believe the item should not be removed and stay on the shelves.      As a child, I have always gone to the child's section of the library to find a book. I steared clear of the 'grown-up' area. So if my mother found an offensive item on the shelves she would make sure I didn't see it. I believe if the parent watches what their child sees then they wouldn't worry about them seeing something offensive.      However, let's say that an adult sees this item and feels it should be removed. She/he has the right to remove that item but what if, to someone else, that item was exactly what they were looking for? The world we live in has many offensive things in it that we see everyday, such as newspapers, @CAPS1 programs, billboards, etc., and if someone were to come along and take it all away, we would have nothing left but that one persons interests.      This is why we have a little bit of everything in our libraries. If there is an offensive book or a bad @CAPS2 and someone doesn't like it and feels the need to remove it, that is @CAPS3 but then they aren't thinking of what other people might like. I have always heard the saying, 'If everybody liked the same thing, it would be a boring world.' I find this to be completely true.      If everybody liked the same thing, then let anybody that enters the library remove an offensive item. However, if this happens, authors won't want to keep writing books and singers won't want their @CAPS4 there if they find out someone keeps removing their work. On the same note, people won't want to go to the library if they know they won't find what they want because someone took it down.      I disagree with the ones who feel the item should be removed because to someone that book might be perfect. I believe that the book or magazine or @CAPS2 should stay on the shelf for someone who has the intent to read it. If a person walks by and feels the book is offensive, they need realize that to someone else it might not be and walk away. I am sure people would find my choice of books offensive or bad and would like to remove them from shelves. However, I would stop going to the library if that happened. This is why I feel books should stay where there are\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear stance against censorship in libraries and provides a personal perspective to support this viewpoint. The thesis, although somewhat traditional, is articulated clearly and is supported by relevant arguments and personal anecdotes. However, to enhance its effectiveness, the essay could benefit from a more engaging and imaginative introduction. The body paragraphs are well-structured, but transitions between ideas could be smoother to improve the overall flow. The conclusion effectively reiterates the main argument but could offer a more innovative perspective to leave a stronger impression. The word choice is varied and appropriate, demonstrating a good command of vocabulary. Sentence structures are engaging and diverse, contributing to a pleasant reading experience. In terms of conventions, the essay is generally well-written, though there are minor spelling and grammatical errors that need correction. Additionally, the placeholders marked with \"@\" should be addressed to maintain the essay's coherence and clarity. Overall, the essay demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and reflects a genuine personal voice, aligning well with the teacher's emphasis on originality and creative expression.\n---------------------------\n\nYour updated profile should maintain the format of the existing teacher persona.\n"

The more we get lazy. One reason that I say this is because, a computer is a big handy person in reality. Second reason is, people stay in the house sitting down on the computer other than exercising. The third reason is, people just sit in the house, and an't enjoy fresh air with their loved ones. First, the reason why I say a computer is a big handy person because it does most of the things a human can do. That can lead a person to being very lazy. Just too sit in the house and go to websites. It has a big effect on a humans life. The computer technology have contecll over a huge population of recae. It really make miss out on half of their day. Second, people stay in the house on the computer other than exercising. It's very unhealthy for a person to sit down at a computer all day. The person has to eat so, basicly they eat and sit back down at the computer. It can get out hand because the computer allows people to grace food online. So that right there is an example of people not getting ecersise, and being lazy. You need to get your ecersise dayly. So people that doesnt get their ecersise need to start. Instead of sitting down on the computer all day. Third, many people over whole world have a lot of love one's that they care about and love. \"But\" they dnt get time to be with them, because they are always on the computer. The computer shouldn't take you away from you outdoor life. Okay, so what you can talk fo your friend and family over the computer. It's never like seeing them in person. Go outside and have fun and happy memories with your family. Because the computer is just words being texted. It's nothing like being said. I garrented you that. If you spend time with youre family then you will want to do it again. While your going out excersise and be interacting. In conclusion, if you are allways on the compute that's not good. Just take a few hours out of the day and ecersise. Go out and have a marvelous day. Because the computer doesn't do nothing but make you lazirer (@CAPS1 YOU). If your allways on the computer just be sure that you get your ecersise and your time with your family. It will make your a better person!\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear opinion on the negative effects of excessive computer usage, but it struggles with clarity and structure. The thesis is evident, although the phrasing is awkward and lacks specificity. The arguments provided are practical and relevant, focusing on health, socialization, and physical activity. However, they are not well-developed and lack concrete real-world examples. The organization is somewhat effective, with a basic structure of introduction, body, and conclusion, but the transitions between ideas are choppy, and some points are redundant. The language and style need improvement; the vocabulary is limited, and there are numerous grammatical errors, misspellings, and awkward sentence constructions that impede readability. To enhance the essay, it would be beneficial to use more precise language, provide stronger supporting evidence, and improve sentence structure and transitions. Additionally, addressing the numerous grammatical errors will make the text more polished and easier to follow. Overall, while the essay conveys the main ideas, it requires significant revisions to meet the standards of clear, concise, and practical writing.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: In this memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The @CAPS1 prints of Our Lives the mood was very happy and made me thankful. My grandparents moved to the @CAPS2.S when my mom was just six. They wanted to give her and her brothers and sisters a better life. This is why I am thankful. I live in the @LOCATION1. The mood is also happy because everyone loved eachother. They didnt have the nicest home, but it was full of love. The music was always playing and Family came a lot. The door was always open in the Rodriguez house. The last sentence in this memoir \"I will never Forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" This made me smile it was so beautiful. This is how the mood was happy and made me thankful. The next time I see my grand parents I will make shure to thank them for moving to the @CAPS2.S and giving are Family a better life.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay does not fully meet the criteria outlined in the guidelines. The content lacks a clear, relevant thesis and offers minimal development of arguments with real-world examples. The conclusion, while attempting to reinforce the initial sentiment, falls short in effectiveness. Organizationally, the essay is weak, with unclear transitions and poorly defined topic sentences, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. The language and style are hampered by frequent grammatical errors, incorrect punctuation, and a limited, often repetitive vocabulary. Additionally, the essay significantly lacks coherence and logical structure, resulting in a disjointed narrative. To improve, focus on creating a clear thesis, supporting arguments with detailed real-world examples, and ensuring logical flow with well-defined topic sentences and smooth transitions.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Do i think that if books, movies, music, magazines, etc should be removed from the shelves just becuase they are offensive? No, i don't think that the stuff should be removed from the shelves just becuase someone thinks or takes it to be offensive. Let's say this ok if we had everybody go and say that this book is offensive, or I don't think this movie should be on this shelve because i think it's offensive or this or that then we wouldn't have anything to wacht, lissin to, or even read. I under stand that yes people do have rights and there believes on something but it doesn't mean that they have any say so on what should stay or what should go.           If we let people do this than nobody would be abel to wacht, read, play,  or even lissin to for fun. Us people used these thing for haveing something to keep us intertaned. Let's say this ok we all know how littel children have thier emanginashon and they used that to keep them intertaned just like us older people used books, music, movies, and ect to keep us intertand. Well if we don't have this stuff than we would be lost and won't know what to do with out that stuff. Just's think of our littel kids if we take there emanginashon away than they would be lost and hoples because that's how they learn and grow up.     We people used this every day use to not onley keep us intertaned but to also help us learn more about what every we need to learn about to survive in every day life. See in ways we are not so diffrent from our chiledren at all realy. they used what every they find or see to keep them intertaned and for enjoiment. If people realy thought about what they are realy going to do by removing something from the shelves than they would regreat that what they did was stupied because now they don't have anything to read, lissin to, or even wacht. I my own self had experience on what it's like to have something like that polled down from the shelves befor and it's realy not cool at all fore that to happen. Takeing something off the shelfs that is alittel bit offensive doesn't meen that it should be tooken off the shelves.     I think that if people who took something off the shelves just becase one person thought that it was offensive if wrong and should not take somthing down that maby other people like. I mean just look at what the thing is talking about first and see if it's offensive to you or not and maybe it's something that people could learn from. Taking something down befor even reading it your self is stupied on be hafe of your part becasue maby other people like and maby you like it who knows. I just think that people should realy think befor they go and take something off the shelves with out haveing alote of people giveing you a bad coment on it befor just taking one persons opean on it.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay you provided needs substantial improvement in several areas to meet the guidelines outlined by the teacher. The content of the essay is somewhat unclear and minimally developed; the arguments presented are not well-supported with real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning, making it difficult to understand the main points. The organization of the essay is weak, with ideas presented in a fragmented and disjointed manner. The lack of coherent transitions between sentences and paragraphs further disrupts the flow of the essay, making it hard for the reader to follow the argument. Word choice is poor, with numerous spelling errors and inappropriate vocabulary that detracts from the overall message. Sentence fluency is also lacking, with awkward constructions and repetitive phrasing that impede readability. Additionally, there are frequent grammatical errors, incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization issues that significantly distract the reader. To improve, the essay should focus on presenting a clear and relevant thesis statement, developing well-supported arguments with practical examples, and concluding effectively. Enhancing the organization with clear topic sentences and transitions, using appropriate and precise vocabulary, and adhering to standard writing conventions will also contribute to a higher quality essay.\n---------------------------\n\nYour updated profile should maintain the format of the existing teacher persona.\n"
