        "llmPrompt": "\nTASK: The goal is to generate feedback for a highlighted passage (STUDENT ESSAY TEXT) from a student's essay as if it were written by the teacher. Provide feedback that is aligned with the teacher's style and the class needs. Use all of the information at your disposable to customize to the teacher and class. Take the teacher instruction into account, in case they emphasize specifically what they want you to do.\n\n---------------------------\n\n----- TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is a persona of the teacher. Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.\n\n----- UPDATED TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is the revised profile of the teacher based on the given feedback examples.\n\nThe teacher\u2019s primary goal is to develop students' ability to construct well-reasoned, evidence-based arguments by teaching them to craft precise thesis statements, structure essays logically, and support arguments with substantial evidence and sound reasoning. They also emphasize technical precision and linguistic correctness, including the appropriate use of technical terminology and attention to grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Their teaching style is characterized by a strong emphasis on clarity, precision, and logical reasoning, focusing on content, organization, language, style, and conventions. \n\nIn feedback, the teacher consistently addresses the following key components:\n\n1. **Thesis Statement:** The teacher emphasizes the importance of a clear and precise thesis statement that provides a strong foundation for the argument. They often suggest ways to refine and strengthen the thesis to better guide the essay.\n\n2. **Evidence and Support:** The teacher encourages students to provide substantial evidence and detailed examples to bolster their main points. They highlight the need for more depth and specificity in arguments to make them more convincing.\n\n3. **Organization and Coherence:** The teacher pays close attention to the logical organization of essays, emphasizing the need for clear transitions and well-defined topic sentences. They often point out disjointed ideas and suggest ways to improve the narrative flow and coherence.\n\n4. **Language Use and Precision:** The teacher underscores the importance of varied and precise vocabulary to convey ideas more powerfully. They provide feedback on moments of basic or imprecise language use, suggesting enhancements to improve overall readability and effectiveness.\n\n5. **Grammatical Accuracy:** The teacher meticulously checks for grammatical errors, including issues with capitalization, punctuation, and awkward sentence structures. They provide detailed corrections to help students understand and avoid errors in future writing.\n\n6. **Engagement and Interest:** The teacher recognizes the importance of engaging storytelling techniques to hold the reader's interest. They often critique repetitive or lackluster narratives, suggesting ways to make the content more engaging and compelling.\n\nUltimately, the teacher strives to create a supportive and intellectually stimulating environment, encouraging students to think critically, write clearly, and refine their academic skills for future success. They aim to build students' confidence in their writing abilities by providing constructive, detailed, and actionable feedback that addresses both strengths and areas for improvement.\n\n\n\n----- FEEDBACK -----\nHere are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 people use computers but not every one agress that it benefits society. In my opinion, computers benefit society. There are @CAPS1 websites that can help you find information. Computers also allow people to work easily. A third reason is @CAPS1 companies are able to use them to gain business. If you are doing a project or need to look up information about something, the internet is one of the easiest ways to find that information. Google.com has so much information\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: This essay presents a clear stance on the benefits of computers to society and supports the thesis with relevant examples and logical reasoning. However, the thesis could be more precise to provide a stronger foundation for the argument. The essay is well-organized, with clear transitions between points, although the topic sentences could be more defined to enhance readability. The use of language is mostly effective, but there are moments where vocabulary could be more varied and precise to convey the intended message more powerfully. Sentence structures are generally clear and varied, contributing to a smooth flow of ideas. On the other hand, the essay has several minor grammatical errors and some issues with capitalization, which slightly impede the overall readability. Strengthening the thesis statement, refining topic sentences, and correcting grammatical errors would further enhance the clarity, structure, and content of this essay.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 these days are telling kids to go outside instead of vegging out in front of a computer. Computers can but promote bad habits. I try not to use the computer unless I have too for school or to get homework. Please consider the negative effects which are exercising in apropprate content and less interaction with friends/family. Yes internets can be used to find diets and exercise plans but if you would just go to the gym to burn of those pounds everything would be just fine!\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the negative effects of computer usage, primarily focusing on issues such as lack of exercise, exposure to inappropriate content, and reduced social interactions. However, the thesis statement lacks precision and clarity, and the arguments, though supported by personal anecdotes, are not substantiated with substantial evidence or data. The logical progression of ideas is somewhat present but fragmented, impacting the overall coherence. The structure of the essay could benefit from better-defined topic sentences and smoother transitions between paragraphs. The vocabulary used is appropriate, though there are areas where word choice could be more precise to enhance the overall message. Sentence structures are varied but occasionally awkward, which disrupts the flow of the essay. Grammatical errors, incorrect spelling, and punctuation issues are present but do not severely impede readability. Overall, while the essay conveys a personal perspective on the topic, it would benefit from stronger organization, clearer thesis articulation, and more robust evidence-based support to effectively persuade the reader.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: all you have to do is make one and then you can print out one-hundred. Using computers helps society. you can easily find what you are looking for and you are able talk to anyone you want. Also, it is easy for companies to attract business. Those are only a few of the @CAPS1 reasons why computers are good for society.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: This essay presents a clear stance on the benefits of computers to society and supports the thesis with relevant examples and logical reasoning.

In conclusion, internet these days are very good for people.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Dear Student,\n\nYour essay clearly attempts to engage with the topic of computers and their role in society. You've made an effort to highlight both the benefits of using computers, such as looking up information and staying connected with friends and family, and some potential drawbacks. Let's go through some specific areas where your writing can be strengthened:\n\n1. **Thesis Statement:**\n   - Your thesis needs to be more precise and clearly stated. A strong thesis will provide a solid foundation for your arguments and guide your essay effectively. Consider revising your thesis to explicitly state your main argument about the benefits or drawbacks of computer usage.\n\n2. **Evidence and Support:**\n   - You mention research vaguely, which is a good start, but you need to provide more detailed and substantial evidence to support your claims. For instance, instead of saying \"Reseach shows over @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 says computer is everything,\" provide specific statistics or studies that back up your point. Adding more depth and specificity will strengthen your argument and make it more convincing.\n\n3. **Organization and Coherence:**\n   - The flow of ideas in your essay is somewhat fragmented. Make sure each paragraph has a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea, followed by supporting sentences that explain and expand on the topic. Use clear transitions between ideas to enhance the overall coherence of your essay.\n\n4. **Language Use and Precision:**\n   - While your language is generally understandable, it could be more precise and varied to convey your ideas more powerfully. For instance, instead of saying \"We sure need computer to look up information these days,\" you could say, \"Computers have become essential tools for information retrieval in modern society.\" This revision is more precise and impactful.\n\n5. **Grammatical Accuracy:**\n   - There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrases that need attention. For example:\n     - \"dident\" should be \"didn't.\"\n     - \"Reseach\" should be \"Research.\"\n     - \"oppinion\" should be \"opinion.\"\n     - The sentence \"For little world neve should get to bed at least @NUM1 pm\" is unclear and needs to be rephrased for clarity.\n   - Pay close attention to punctuation and capitalization to ensure your writing is technically precise. Proofreading your work can help catch these errors.\n\n6. **Engagement and Interest:**\n   - Your essay has potential, but it can be more engaging by incorporating compelling examples and anecdotes. Try to make your narrative more interesting by varying sentence structures and using vivid language.\n\nIn conclusion, your essay addresses a relevant topic, but it needs a more precise thesis, stronger evidence, better organization, more precise language, and grammatical accuracy. By focusing on these areas, you can significantly enhance the clarity, structure, and persuasiveness of your writing.\n\nKeep working on refining these elements, and you'll see your writing improve. Great effort, and I look forward to reading your revised essay.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[",

They can be against some peoples religion and way of life.     I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf. Now they are putting those same books in libraries. These books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them. Are these books you want your children to be reading?      There are even movies that are like those books. Many shows are based of a book series, and that series @MONTH1 not be a good one. The series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers. The kids could see something they think is really neat on the @CAPS1 and then go out and try that. They do not understand that what they do @MONTH1 not be a good thing. They could get into a lot more trouble then they want to get in.     I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all. In my opinion, the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them. After that, the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them.

Take the teacher instruction into account, in case they emphasize specifically what they want you to do.\n\n---------------------------\n\n----- TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is a persona of the teacher. Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.\n\n----- UPDATED TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is the revised profile of the teacher based on the given feedback examples.\n\nThe teacher\u2019s primary goal is to develop students' ability to construct well-reasoned, evidence-based arguments by teaching them to craft precise thesis statements, structure essays logically, and support arguments with substantial evidence and sound reasoning. They also emphasize technical precision and linguistic correctness, including the appropriate use of technical terminology and attention to grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Their teaching style is characterized by a strong emphasis on clarity, precision, and logical reasoning, focusing on content, organization, language, style, and conventions. \n\nIn feedback, the teacher consistently addresses the following key components:\n\n1. **Thesis Statement:** The teacher emphasizes the importance of a clear and precise thesis statement that provides a strong foundation for the argument. They often suggest ways to refine and strengthen the thesis to better guide the essay.\n\n2. **Evidence and Support:** The teacher encourages students to provide substantial evidence and detailed examples to bolster their main points. They highlight the need for more depth and specificity in arguments to make them more convincing.\n\n3. **Organization and Coherence:** The teacher pays close attention to the logical organization of essays, emphasizing the need for clear transitions and well-defined topic sentences. They often point out disjointed ideas and suggest ways to improve the narrative flow and coherence.\n\n4. **Language Use and Precision:** The teacher underscores the importance of varied and precise vocabulary to convey ideas more powerfully. They provide feedback on moments of basic or imprecise language use, suggesting enhancements to improve overall readability and effectiveness.\n\n5. **Grammatical Accuracy:** The teacher meticulously checks for grammatical errors, including issues with capitalization, punctuation, and awkward sentence structures. They provide detailed corrections to help students understand and avoid errors in future writing.\n\n6. **Engagement and Interest:** The teacher recognizes the importance of engaging storytelling techniques to hold the reader's interest. They often critique repetitive or lackluster narratives, suggesting ways to make the content more engaging and compelling.\n\nUltimately, the teacher strives to create a supportive and intellectually stimulating environment, encouraging students to think critically, write clearly, and refine their academic skills for future success. They aim to build students' confidence in their writing abilities by providing constructive, detailed, and actionable feedback that addresses both strengths and areas for improvement.\n\n\n\n----- FEEDBACK -----\nHere are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. I believe that even if books, music, movies or magazines on the bookshelves are offense, they should still be left there. They are apart of our history and the history we're creating.

The central argument\u2014that censorship is futile given technological access and potentially harmful to community dynamics\u2014is reasonably well-articulated, though it could benefit from more specific and detailed support. The essay lacks a cohesive structure, with ideas presented in a somewhat disjointed manner. Clearer transitions and a more organized flow of arguments would enhance readability and effectiveness. The vocabulary used is appropriate and conveys the intended message, though there are some areas where more precise language could strengthen the argument. Sentence structures are varied but occasionally awkward, disrupting the overall fluidity of the text. While the essay demonstrates a good command of basic writing conventions, a few grammatical errors and inconsistencies (such as \"i've\" instead of \"I've\") need attention. Overall, the essay makes a strong case but would benefit from a more polished and systematically organized presentation.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: that could be debated about being censored.     A lot of books and movies, great ones even, contain some offensive content but they are classics. Generations, one after the other, have enjoyed them.     Now tell me, who would want to be the unreasonable person and take that away from anyone who is interested? Everyone should have the right to these books, magazines, movies, and music. Libraries should not censor them.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay on censorship in libraries presents a clear stance against the practice, advocating for the preservation of all materials regardless of their potential to offend.

I would like more organization for certian things, I do know people have their own ideas about things that should be in a book. These books found in a library could bring enjoyment to people,\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear stance on the need for a more organized system in libraries to help users avoid content they may find offensive. However, the thesis lacks precision and could benefit from a more focused statement of purpose. The arguments presented are somewhat repetitive and underdeveloped, lacking substantial evidence or logical reasoning to support the proposed solution. The essay is disorganized, with ideas not flowing logically from one to the next. Transitions between paragraphs are weak, making it difficult to follow the argument. The language used is simplistic and contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors, which detract from the essay's overall effectiveness. Additionally, the sentence structures are often awkward and unclear, further impeding readability. To improve, the essay needs a clearer thesis, better-developed arguments supported by concrete evidence, a more logical organization, varied and precise word choice, and meticulous proofreading to correct language conventions.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

These materials @MONTH1 not be offensive to some people, but it can be to others. They can be against some peoples religion and way of life.     I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf. Now they are putting those same books in libraries. These books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them. Are these books you want your children to be reading?      There are even movies that are like those books. Many shows are based of a book series, and that series @MONTH1 not be a good one. The series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers. The kids could see something they think is really neat on the @CAPS1 and then go out and try that. They do not understand that what they do @MONTH1 not be a good thing. They could get into a lot more trouble then they want to get in.     I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all. In my opinion, the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them. After that, the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them.     There are some that would agree with my opinion and some that would not. What do you think? Do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way? Would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good? Or do you want them to know what they should and should not do?\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "The essay presents a clear argument in favor of restricting access to certain offensive materials in libraries, particularly focusing on the potential negative influence on children. This is a strong stance that resonates with many readers, but the argument needs further development and organization for maximum impact.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement:**\n   - Your thesis is present but could be more clearly defined. Try consolidating your main points into a single, strong thesis statement at the beginning. For example, \"Libraries should restrict access to highly offensive materials to protect children and teenagers from exposure to harmful content.\"\n\n2. **Evidence and Support:**\n   - You bring up important points about the potential harm of violent and inappropriate content. However, your argument would benefit significantly from more concrete examples and evidence. Consider citing specific books or studies that support your claims about the negative impact of violent content on youth.\n\n3. **Organization and Coherence:**\n   - The essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Currently, your points are somewhat scattered. Organize your essay into clear paragraphs each focusing on a single point. For instance, one paragraph could discuss the impact of violent content on children, another could discuss the role of parental guidance, and another could focus on the responsibilities of libraries.\n\n4. **Language Use and Precision:**\n   - Your language is understandable, but there are areas where more precise vocabulary could enhance your argument. For example, instead of saying \"bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way,\" you could say \"detrimental and potentially life-altering influences.\"\n\n5. **Grammatical Accuracy:**\n   - There are several grammatical errors throughout the essay that need attention. For example, \"Many shows are based of a book series\" should be \"Many shows are based on a book series.\" Additionally, ensure that you are consistently using correct punctuation and capitalization. Words like \"@MONTH1\" and \"@CAPS1\" appear to be placeholders and need to be corrected.\n\n6. **Engagement and Interest:**\n   - Your essay raises important questions that are likely to engage readers. However, asking too many rhetorical questions can dilute the strength of your argument. Consider focusing on a few key questions to leave a lasting impression on your audience.\n\n**Overall Suggestions for Improvement:**\n- Refine your thesis statement for clarity and strength.\n- Support your arguments with specific, concrete examples and evidence.\n- Organize your essay into clear, logical paragraphs.\n- Use more precise and varied vocabulary to convey your points effectively.\n- Correct grammatical errors and ensure proper punctuation and capitalization throughout.\n- Streamline your rhetorical questions to make a more powerful impact.\n\nYour essay has a compelling foundation, and with these revisions, it can become a more persuasive and polished piece. Keep up the good work, and continue to refine your writing skills!",

Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.\n\n----- UPDATED TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is the revised profile of the teacher based on the given feedback examples.\n\nThe teacher\u2019s primary goal is to develop students' ability to construct well-reasoned, evidence-based arguments by teaching them to craft precise thesis statements, structure essays logically, and support arguments with substantial evidence and sound reasoning. They also emphasize technical precision and linguistic correctness, including the appropriate use of technical terminology and attention to grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Their teaching style is characterized by a strong emphasis on clarity, precision, and logical reasoning, focusing on content, organization, language, style, and conventions. \n\nIn feedback, the teacher consistently addresses the following key components:\n\n1. **Thesis Statement:** The teacher emphasizes the importance of a clear and precise thesis statement that provides a strong foundation for the argument. They often suggest ways to refine and strengthen the thesis to better guide the essay.\n\n2. **Evidence and Support:** The teacher encourages students to provide substantial evidence and detailed examples to bolster their main points. They highlight the need for more depth and specificity in arguments to make them more convincing.\n\n3. **Organization and Coherence:** The teacher pays close attention to the logical organization of essays, emphasizing the need for clear transitions and well-defined topic sentences. They often point out disjointed ideas and suggest ways to improve the narrative flow and coherence.\n\n4. **Language Use and Precision:** The teacher underscores the importance of varied and precise vocabulary to convey ideas more powerfully. They provide feedback on moments of basic or imprecise language use, suggesting enhancements to improve overall readability and effectiveness.\n\n5. **Grammatical Accuracy:** The teacher meticulously checks for grammatical errors, including issues with capitalization, punctuation, and awkward sentence structures. They provide detailed corrections to help students understand and avoid errors in future writing.\n\n6. **Engagement and Interest:** The teacher recognizes the importance of engaging storytelling techniques to hold the reader's interest.

The thesis is somewhat clear, but the arguments supporting it are not sufficiently developed with concrete evidence or logical reasoning. The brief quotes provided from the source text are relevant but are not adequately integrated into the essay to enhance the argument. Additionally, the essay needs a more robust conclusion that synthesizes the points discussed. The organization is basic, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, but it lacks coherent transitions and well-defined topic sentences, which makes the flow of ideas somewhat choppy. The language used is simplistic and contains several grammatical errors, such as punctuation mistakes and improper use of capitalization, which detract from the overall readability and effectiveness. To improve, the essay should incorporate more substantial evidence from the text, use precise and varied vocabulary, and ensure grammatical accuracy to enhance clarity and impact.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay on the cyclist\u2019s experience conveys the main idea but lacks depth and detail.

While the central idea is identifiable, it lacks depth and specificity, requiring more substantial evidence and detailed examples to bolster the main points. The essay's organization is somewhat disjointed, with ideas not fully fleshed out or logically connected, leading to a lack of smooth narrative flow. Transitional phrases and topic sentences are sparse, which hampers the coherence and fluidity of the text. Furthermore, the language used is basic and occasionally imprecise, with some grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures that detract from the overall readability. Enhancing the clarity of arguments, providing more detailed examples, and polishing the language would significantly improve the effectiveness of the essay.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

No, a better piece \nof advice for the solo cyclist would be, \u201cNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers \nwho haven\u2019t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.\u201d It\u2019s not that a group of \nold guys doesn\u2019t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid \nplace. Things change. \nAt a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer \nevening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn\u2019t have done was \nlet them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice \nand launched out at first light along a \u201cshortcut\u201d that was to slice away hours from my ride to \nYosemite National Park. \nThey\u2019d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I \nwould come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with \nstrong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first \u201ctown.\u201d \nThis place might have been a thriving little spot at one time\u2014say, before the last world war\u2014but \non that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water \nsupply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool \npines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. \nTwenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, \nand a corral that couldn\u2019t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had \nbeen hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of \nCalifornia in June. \nI got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my \nstrength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the \nneighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water \nwouldn\u2019t cool down. It didn\u2019t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. \nThe old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make \nthat! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so\u2014a test of my inner spirit. \nNot two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was \nreplaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign \njumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. \nThe speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so \ncruel. \nI toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake\u2014it \nreally did look like a diamondback\u2014blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased \npast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. \nThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my \nshirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June \nsimply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn\u2019t been off their porch in decades, \ncaused me to laugh. \nIt was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. \nThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride \ndown into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I\u2019d \nbe fine. \nOver one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make \nsure it wasn\u2019t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst \nof energy, I maneuvered down the hill. \nIn an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building\u2014abandoned years \nearlier, by the looks of it\u2014had been a Welch\u2019s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A \nsandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still \nbe seen. \nI hung my head. \nThat smoky blues tune \u201cSummertime\u201d rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating \nbrain. \nI got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. \nI\u2019d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you \nhave left to circulate. With any luck I\u2019d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. \nIt didn\u2019t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some \nexpensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and \ntheir keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I \nwas going to lose consciousness for the last time. \nSomehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining \nelevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear \nwere all behind me. \nGARY AND WILBER\u2019S FISH CAMP\u2014IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE\u2019RE \nYOUR BEST BET! \n\u201cAnd the only bet,\u201d I remember thinking. \nAs I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an \noverwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait\u2014any bait, even \nthough I didn\u2019t own a rod or reel. \nAn old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from \nmy head as I slumped against the wall beside him. \n\u201cWhere you headed in such a hurry?\u201d \n\u201cYosemite,\u201d I whispered. \n\u201cKnow the best way to get there?\u201d \nI watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group \nI\u2019d listened to in Lodi. \n\u201cYes, sir! I own a very good map.\u201d \nAnd I promised myself right then that I\u2019d always stick to it in the future. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-3-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 3 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nWrite a response that explains how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.

        "llmResponse": "Thank you for your effort in addressing how the setting affected the cyclist. While your response touches on a central point of the cyclist's experience, it lacks the depth and specificity needed to fully support your conclusion. Let's break down areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Thesis Statement:** Your thesis is present but could be more precise. Instead of stating, \"The setting affected the cyclist, because he didn't know if he was going to die or live,\" try refining it to clarify the specific elements of the setting that had the most significant impact. For example, \"The harsh desert setting critically affected the cyclist's physical and mental state due to extreme heat and lack of water.\"\n\n2. **Evidence and Support:** Your main points about the heat and dry mouth are on the right track but need more substantial evidence from the text. For instance, you could include specific quotes that illustrate the severity of the heat and dehydration, such as, \"The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June...\"\n\n3. **Organization and Coherence:** Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Start with a topic sentence that introduces the main point of each paragraph. For example, \"The extreme heat of the California desert was a major challenge for the cyclist.\" This sets up the paragraph to discuss specific examples and their effects in a logical order.\n\n4. **Language Use and Precision:** Aim to use more varied and precise vocabulary to convey your ideas powerfully. Instead of saying, \"it was so hot and his mouth was dry,\" consider, \"the relentless heat caused severe dehydration, leaving his mouth parched.\"\n\n5. **Grammatical Accuracy:** Your writing would be more effective with attention to grammatical details. Ensure sentences are complete and punctuation is correctly used. For example, \"The setting affected the cyclist because he didn\u2019t know if he was going to die or live. He had used up all his water due to the intense heat, which left his mouth dry.\"\n\n6. **Engagement and Interest:** Make your narrative more engaging by incorporating vivid descriptions and reflecting on the cyclist's emotional state. For example, \"As the sun beat down mercilessly, the cyclist's hope dwindled with every pedal stroke, highlighting the cruel irony of his situation.\"\n\nBy focusing on these areas, you'll create a more compelling and well-supported essay. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to dive deeper into the text for stronger evidence. Well done on your initial effort!",

Also the girl wants to overcome her obstacle at a certain time.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents an attempt to answer the prompt; however, it falls short in several key areas. The thesis of the essay lacks clarity and precision, making it difficult for the reader to grasp the main argument being presented. The points made are somewhat vague and not well supported with specific evidence or logical reasoning. There are no examples or details from the story to substantiate the claims, leaving the arguments unconvincing. Additionally, the structure of the essay is disjointed. There is an absence of coherent transitions and well-defined topic sentences, which disrupts the logical flow of ideas and makes the narrative hard to follow. The language and style are not suitable for an academic essay, with several grammatical errors, incorrect punctuation, and awkward sentence structures that hinder readability. Technical terminology is not utilized effectively, leading to a lack of precision and variety in vocabulary. Overall, the essay needs significant improvement in content development, organization, and language use to meet the standards of evidence-based argumentation and logical reasoning.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: What Saeng means at the end of the paragraph is that where it is a seasson for those plants she will take the test again. The test to begin to like like the plot. Like features and characters about. Also the history about these plants.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is significantly lacking in clarity, structure, and content coherence. The central idea of what Saeng means at the end of the paragraph is not clear, and the arguments presented are vague and unsupported by any substantial evidence or logical reasoning. The essay is exceptionally brief and does not offer a concrete thesis or any developed arguments. The sentences are fragmented, and there is a noticeable absence of transitional phrases and logical progression, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. Additionally, the vocabulary is not used effectively, and the language is simplistic and imprecise. Grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, and spelling mistakes further impede the readability of the essay. Overall, the essay does not meet the expectations for a well-reasoned, evidence-based argument and falls short in all evaluated categories. It is crucial to develop a clear thesis, provide detailed and logical support for arguments, ensure smooth transitions, and maintain grammatical accuracy for future submissions.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: simple house into a home.\", what this means is that he is greatful for the life he had. So he will never forget the gratitude that fills him up inside.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the memoir's main theme of gratitude, with specific references to Narciso Rodriguez\u2019s experiences and emotions towards his parents. The thesis is reasonably clear, focused on the idea of gratitude, and supported with relevant examples from the memoir. However, the clarity of the thesis could be enhanced with a more precise statement at the beginning. The structure of the essay shows logical progression, with well-defined paragraphs and a coherent flow of ideas, though some transitions could be smoother to enhance readability. The use of technical terminology and vocabulary is appropriate, and the sentence structures are varied and generally correct, though there are minor grammatical errors that could be refined for higher precision. The conclusion effectively synthesizes the arguments presented, reinforcing the theme of gratitude and the impact of the parents' sacrifices on the author's life. Overall, the essay is engaging and maintains the reader's interest, with good use of evidence from the memoir to support its points. To improve, the essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement, smoother transitions, and minor grammatical corrections.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus \nby Minfong Ho \nSaeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng\nwalks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist\nshop to see if the plant can be purchased. \nIt was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat\nleaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in\nseemingly random profusion. \n\u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy\npotted plant by the corner. \nThere, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals\nsplayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of\nrecognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \n\u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. \nA saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with\nvermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into\nthe well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the\nbucket. \nSlowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,\noleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had\nnot even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. \nWhen she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and\ncool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. \nAnd beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with\npurplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to\nsee it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick\nwalls or between tiled roofs. \nAnd that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and\nfound a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.\n\u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said,\nsavoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its\ntag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d \nOne of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed\nher eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could\nalmost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she\ncombed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng\nwould help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. \nSaeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm\naround it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed\ncomb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? \nA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a\nchannel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. \nAnd in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. \nIt was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the\nlast remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.\nAs if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of\nthe onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to\nher. \nHer smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully.\n\u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed\nthe potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. \nMrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere\ndid you get it?\u201d \n\u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \n\u201cHow much?\u201d \nFor answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the \nLambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \n\u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \n\u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \n\u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this\nvegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much!

Saeng did not dare look her mother in the\neye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. \nHer mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful\nplant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \n\u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the\nwords at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t\nas pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.\nThat\u2019s what matters.\u201d \nShe tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her\nother hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d \nShe went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The\nsoil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair\ntrailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There\nwas a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \n\u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. \nMrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and\nstart dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. \nLeft alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it.\nShe could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,\nthe sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth\nwatered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not\neven Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.\nBut she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. \nThe \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.\nOverhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng\nnow. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange\nbefore had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her\nnow. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against\nthe evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. \nWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the\ngeese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-4-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 4 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nRead the last paragraph of the story. \n\"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and\nthe geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.\" \nWrite a response that explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.

        "llmResponse": "Thank you for your brief response. However, it significantly lacks the depth and detail required to address the essay prompt effectively. Here are several areas where your response can be improved:\n\n1. **Thesis Statement:** Your response does not include a clear thesis statement. A strong thesis should articulate why the author concludes the story with Saeng's vow to retake the test in the spring. Consider starting with a sentence that clearly states your main argument, setting the stage for the rest of your essay.\n\n2. **Evidence and Support:** Your response is very brief and does not provide any supporting evidence from the story. To strengthen your argument, you need to include specific examples and details from \"Winter Hibiscus\" that explain why Saeng's vow is significant. For instance, discuss the symbolism of the hibiscus and the geese, and how Saeng's experiences and emotions throughout the story lead to her determination to try again.\n\n3. **Organization and Coherence:** The response lacks structure. A well-organized essay should have an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Each paragraph should have a clear topic sentence and smooth transitions to guide the reader through your argument. \n\n4. **Language Use and Precision:** The vocabulary in your response is very basic. Aim to use more varied and precise language to convey your ideas more powerfully. Descriptive language and technical terminology appropriate to the story and its themes will strengthen your analysis.\n\n5. **Grammatical Accuracy:** Although your sentence is grammatically correct, more complex sentence structures can enhance the readability and interest of your essay. Ensure that you avoid overly simplistic language and consider varying your sentence lengths and types.\n\n6. **Engagement and Interest:** Your response is quite terse and does not engage the reader. To make your essay more compelling, weave in elements that draw the reader into Saeng's emotional journey and the broader themes of the text. \n\nHere is an example of how you might start your improved response:\n\n\"Saeng's vow to retake the driving test in the spring epitomizes her resilience and hope for the future, despite the difficulties she faces as an immigrant adjusting to a new life in the United States. The concluding paragraph of 'Winter Hibiscus' highlights the significance of the hibiscus and the geese as symbols of Saeng's connection to her past and her determination to succeed in her new environment.\"\n\nBy expanding on this idea and providing specific examples from the text, your essay will become more detailed, structured, and convincing.\n\nKeep working on developing your thesis, supporting your arguments with evidence, organizing your thoughts clearly, and using precise language to improve your writing skills. I am confident that with practice, you will be able to construct well-reasoned, evidence-based arguments.",

The thesis is reasonably clear, focused on the idea of gratitude, and supported with relevant examples from the memoir. However, the clarity of the thesis could be enhanced with a more precise statement at the beginning. The structure of the essay shows logical progression, with well-defined paragraphs and a coherent flow of ideas, though some transitions could be smoother to enhance readability. The use of technical terminology and vocabulary is appropriate, and the sentence structures are varied and generally correct, though there are minor grammatical errors that could be refined for higher precision. The conclusion effectively synthesizes the arguments presented, reinforcing the theme of gratitude and the impact of the parents' sacrifices on the author's life. Overall, the essay is engaging and maintains the reader's interest, with good use of evidence from the memoir to support its points. To improve, the essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement, smoother transitions, and minor grammatical corrections.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created by the author in this memoir was nostalgic. @PERSON1 remembers all the happy times he had, and memories that took place in his home. In paragraph two, he reflects back on how in his traditional Cuban home, where the heart was the kitchen.

The clear and well-supported thesis regarding the nostalgic atmosphere is consistently backed by specific examples, such as the vivid descriptions of the Cuban kitchen, the familial gatherings, and the cultural solidarity in the neighborhood. The narrative flows logically from one point to the next, with each paragraph building on the previous one to create a cohesive and compelling story. Moreover, the use of technical terminology and a varied, precise vocabulary enhances the readability and depth of the essay. The sentence structures are complex yet clear, contributing to an engaging and sophisticated writing style. Additionally, the essay maintains grammatical accuracy, with minimal errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, ensuring that the content is delivered effectively. Overall, the essay demonstrates a strong alignment with the guidelines, showcasing evidence-based arguments, logical progression, and linguistic precision.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful. The author proved that it doesn't take the amount of money, or how big your house is to be happy. Sometimes its just the simple things. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, \"my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" The author is showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood, they still treat each other as if they were.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a general understanding of the memoir's themes, but it lacks a precise and clear thesis statement, resulting in an overall vague argument. While there are some references to specific passages in the memoir, they are not well integrated into the argument, and the connection between the evidence and the points being made is not sufficiently established. The structure of the essay is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of coherent flow from one idea to the next. Additionally, the use of language is basic, with limited vocabulary and several grammatical errors that detract from the overall readability and effectiveness of the essay. The narrative struggles to hold the reader's interest due to its repetitive nature and lack of engaging storytelling techniques. To improve, the essay should focus on developing a clear thesis, integrating evidence seamlessly into the argument, enhancing the logical flow with better transitions, and refining language use to be more varied and precise.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 5 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Narciso Rodriguez \nfrom Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives \nMy parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a \nfurnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old \nNarciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon \ncall home. \nIn 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the \nIronbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our \ntraditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared \ncooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking \nthat is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which \nI adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of \nchildhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed \nboth, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. \nGrowing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \u201cfamily\u201d had nothing to do with \nbeing a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, \nCuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation \nprevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these \ncultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of \nhonest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their \nown kind, were clearly in need. \nOur landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and \nAlegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio \nand Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not \nknow my \u201creal\u201d grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were \nallowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and \nRosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family \nmembers came and went \u2014 and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they \nwere able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the \nmany people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. \nMy mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the \nlanguage or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a \nbetter life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country \nthey loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters \nwhile yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were \nstrong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind \nof jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had \nstudied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, \ntaking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their \nchildren to better times drove them to endure these hard times. \nI will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I\u2019ve often told them that what \nthey did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I\u2019ve often told them of \nmy admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I\u2019ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in \nreality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at \nsuch an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two \nlessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these \nteachings have been the basis of my life. \nIt was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to \nthis country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this \nhumble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not \njust scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of \u201cfamily.\u201d \nAnd for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I \nlearned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into \na home. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-5-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 5 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nDescribe the mood created by the author in the memoir.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay demonstrates an initial grasp of the themes in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, with a focus on the gratitude and pride the author feels towards his parents. However, there are several areas where refinement could significantly improve your work.\n\n**Thesis Statement:** Your thesis statement is currently unclear and somewhat fragmented. To provide a strong foundation for your essay, consider crafting a more precise thesis that clearly states the mood you will be discussing and how it is conveyed through the memoir. For example, you might say, \"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the dominant moods are gratitude and pride, as demonstrated through his reflections on his parents' sacrifices and their compassionate actions.\"\n\n**Evidence and Support:** While you reference several relevant points from the memoir, your evidence could be more specific and detailed. For instance, instead of simply stating that the parents \"let people live at their house,\" you could include more vivid examples such as how \"Alegria, the landlord's daughter, often joined them at their kitchen table, symbolizing the warmth and inclusiveness of their household.\" This will strengthen your argument and provide a clearer connection between your points and the text.\n\n**Organization and Coherence:** The structure of your essay needs improvement to enhance readability. Currently, your ideas are somewhat disjointed, making it hard to follow your argument. Organize your essay into clear paragraphs, each focused on a single main point. Use transitional phrases to connect your thoughts smoothly. For example, you could start a new paragraph with, \"Moreover, the memoir highlights the parents' resilience and perseverance in the face of cultural and financial challenges.\"\n\n**Language Use and Precision:** Your essay would benefit from more varied and precise language. Avoid repetitive phrases and consider using more sophisticated vocabulary to convey your ideas. For instance, instead of saying \"they had a three-bedroom apartment,\" you could say, \"they managed to secure a modest, three-room apartment that became a haven for family and friends.\"\n\n**Grammatical Accuracy:** There are several grammatical errors in your essay that need correction. Ensure you use correct verb forms, subject-verb agreement, and possessive pronouns. For example, \"there\" should be \"their,\" and \"the could get\" should be \"they could get.\" These corrections will enhance the overall clarity and professionalism of your writing.\n\n**Engagement and Interest:** To make your essay more engaging, try to incorporate more descriptive and evocative storytelling techniques. Highlight moments in the memoir that vividly illustrate the mood you are discussing. For instance, you could describe how \"the aromas of Cuban cuisine, mingled with the sounds of passionate music, created a vibrant and loving atmosphere in their home.\"\n\nIn summary, your essay shows potential, but it requires a clearer thesis, more specific evidence, better organization, precise language, grammatical accuracy, and engaging storytelling. By addressing these areas, you can craft a more compelling and effective analysis of the mood in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir. Keep working on these aspects, and you'll surely see improvement",

The main mood in this memoir however is gratitude. @ORGANIZATION1 is very grateful for everything his parents have ever done for him and he loves them with all his heart.

So he will\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the memoir's main theme of gratitude, with specific references to Narciso Rodriguez\u2019s experiences and emotions towards his parents. The thesis is reasonably clear, focused on the idea of gratitude, and supported with relevant examples from the memoir. However, the clarity of the thesis could be enhanced with a more precise statement at the beginning. The structure of the essay shows logical progression, with well-defined paragraphs and a coherent flow of ideas, though some transitions could be smoother to enhance readability. The use of technical terminology and vocabulary is appropriate, and the sentence structures are varied and generally correct, though there are minor grammatical errors that could be refined for higher precision. The conclusion effectively synthesizes the arguments presented, reinforcing the theme of gratitude and the impact of the parents' sacrifices on the author's life. Overall, the essay is engaging and maintains the reader's interest, with good use of evidence from the memoir to support its points. To improve, the essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement, smoother transitions, and minor grammatical corrections.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful. The author proved that it doesn't take the amount of money, or how big your house is to be happy. Sometimes its just the simple things. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, \"my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" The author is showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood, they still treat each other as if they were.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a general understanding of the memoir's themes, but it lacks a precise and clear thesis statement, resulting in an overall vague argument. While there are some references to specific passages in the memoir, they are not well integrated into the argument, and the connection between the evidence and the points being made is not sufficiently established. The structure of the essay is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of coherent flow from one idea to the next. Additionally, the use of language is basic, with limited vocabulary and several grammatical errors that detract from the overall readability and effectiveness of the essay. The narrative struggles to hold the reader's interest due to its repetitive nature and lack of engaging storytelling techniques. To improve, the essay should focus on developing a clear thesis, integrating evidence seamlessly into the argument, enhancing the logical flow with better transitions, and refining language use to be more varied and precise.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created by the author in this memoir was nostalgic. @PERSON1 remembers all the happy times he had, and memories that took place in his home. In paragraph two, he reflects back on how in his traditional Cuban home, where the heart was the kitchen. He remembers his parents love for cooking, and how eternally grateful he is it got passed down to him. @PERSON1 remembers the passionate Cuban music mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. In paragraph three and four, he tells how the\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay effectively captures the nostalgic mood of the memoir through detailed reflections on the author's memories with substantial evidence drawn directly from the text. The clear and well-supported thesis regarding the nostalgic atmosphere is consistently backed by specific examples, such as the vivid descriptions of the Cuban kitchen, the familial gatherings, and the cultural solidarity in the neighborhood. The narrative flows logically from one point to the next, with each paragraph building on the previous one to create a cohesive and compelling story. Moreover, the use of technical terminology and a varied, precise vocabulary enhances the readability and depth of the essay. The sentence structures are complex yet clear, contributing to an engaging and sophisticated writing style. Additionally, the essay maintains grammatical accuracy, with minimal errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, ensuring that the content is delivered effectively. Overall, the essay demonstrates a strong alignment with the guidelines, showcasing evidence-based arguments, logical progression, and linguistic precision.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

After living for a year in a \nfurnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old \nNarciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon \ncall home. \nIn 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the \nIronbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our \ntraditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared \ncooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking \nthat is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which \nI adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of \nchildhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed \nboth, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. \nGrowing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \u201cfamily\u201d had nothing to do with \nbeing a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, \nCuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation \nprevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these \ncultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of \nhonest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their \nown kind, were clearly in need. \nOur landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and \nAlegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio \nand Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not \nknow my \u201creal\u201d grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were \nallowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and \nRosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family \nmembers came and went \u2014 and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they \nwere able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the \nmany people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. \nMy mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the \nlanguage or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a \nbetter life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country \nthey loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters \nwhile yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were \nstrong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind \nof jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had \nstudied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, \ntaking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their \nchildren to better times drove them to endure these hard times. \nI will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I\u2019ve often told them that what \nthey did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I\u2019ve often told them of \nmy admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I\u2019ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in \nreality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at \nsuch an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two \nlessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these \nteachings have been the basis of my life. \nIt was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to \nthis country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this \nhumble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not \njust scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of \u201cfamily.\u201d \nAnd for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I \nlearned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into \na home. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-5-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 5 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nDescribe the mood created by the author in the memoir.

        "llmResponse": "Thank you for your effort in analyzing the mood in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir. Here are some detailed points on how to enhance your essay:\n\n1. **Thesis Statement:**\n   - Your thesis is clear, focusing on the mood of gratitude. However, it could be more precise and explicitly stated at the beginning of your essay. Consider starting with a sentence like, \"The memoir 'Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' by Narciso Rodriguez primarily conveys a mood of gratitude.\"\n\n2. **Evidence and Support:**\n   - You\u2019ve selected relevant quotes that support the theme of gratitude. However, try to integrate the quotes more seamlessly into your analysis. For example, instead of isolating the quote, you might say, \"Rodriguez expresses his gratitude through vivid memories of his parents, stating, 'My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today.' This demonstrates how deeply he values the skills and passions they instilled in him.\"\n   - Additionally, ensure that each piece of evidence you present is clearly linked to your central argument. Avoid repetitive explanations and strive for depth by discussing the significance of these memories in shaping Rodriguez's sense of gratitude.\n\n3. **Organization and Coherence:**\n   - Your essay needs a more logical progression of ideas. Start with a strong introductory paragraph that presents your thesis. Then, structure your body paragraphs around specific aspects of gratitude, such as the parents' sacrifices, the cultural heritage they passed on, and the sense of family and community.\n   - Use clear topic sentences at the beginning of each paragraph to guide the reader through your argument.\n\n4. **Language Use and Precision:**\n   - Your vocabulary is somewhat basic, and there are a few spelling and grammatical errors. For instance, \"unwrittingly\" should be \"unwittingly,\" and \"besis\" should be \"basis.\" Proofread your work to avoid these mistakes and consider using more varied and precise language to enhance your analysis.\n   - Instead of repeating phrases like \"he loves and cherishes his mom and dad,\" try using synonyms or more descriptive language to convey the same idea.\n\n5. **Grammatical Accuracy:**\n   - Pay attention to capitalization, especially with words like \"Parents\" and \"Passed,\" which should be lowercase unless they start a sentence. Also, ensure subject-verb agreement and proper punctuation.\n   - For example, \"What I mean by that is that he is grateful for what he learned from is parents\" should be \"What I mean by that is that he is grateful for what he learned from his parents.\"\n\n6. **Engagement and Interest:**\n   - While your essay addresses the theme of gratitude, it can be more engaging by incorporating more varied sentence structures and storytelling techniques. Aim to create a narrative that holds the reader's interest and vividly conveys Rodriguez's emotions and experiences.\n\n**Revised Example:**\n\n\"The",

        "textSelection": "Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students in @NUM3 grade go on the computer each night to complete homework and to connect with friends and family? I think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. A computer can be used for communication, education, and for accessing important information quickly, such as the local news. Now, let me tell you why computers are good for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a friend who I was very close to and a part of his life. Unfortunately, he had to move away. But I still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while. A convenient way to do this was by using a computer. The computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can @CAPS5 stay in touch. Different types of communication on the computer can be e-mail, instant-messaging, video chat, online chat groups...etc. This helps people stay connected. That's why I think communication is the biggest effect on people due to the use of a computer. But, a computer can also be used for learning. At school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals. For example when my class researched different things about the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, our main source of infromation was the internet on our computers. We researched the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. Also, kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it. This is teaching them hand-eye coordiantion, and how to type. The computer is not @CAPS5 used for just communication. It's a good way to educate everyone although the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information. \"@CAPS6 and adults often check their e-mail and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy, \"says expert @PERSON1. I think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what's going on in our town, state, country, and world. For example, it can tell us about the series of shootings goiong on throughout @LOCATION1 or the many house robberies in our town. Us, @CAPS7 citizens, wnt to know everything... for us to stay safe and notified on the latest. Another example is that I logged on the computer three dats ago and it notified me about the earthquake in @LOCATION2. But there are so many benefits of a computer. The effects computers have on people are beneficial. It allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news. I think you should take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone.",

I think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. A computer can be used for communication, education, and for accessing important information quickly, such as the local news. Now, let me tell you why computers are good for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a friend who I was very close to and a part of his life. Unfortunately, he had to move away. But I still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while. A convenient way to do this was by using a computer. The computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can @CAPS5 stay in touch. Different types of communication on the computer can be e-mail, instant-messaging, video chat, online chat groups...etc. This helps people stay connected. That's why I think communication is the biggest effect on people due to the use of a computer. But, a computer can also be used for learning. At school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals. For example when my class researched different things about the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, our main source of infromation was the internet on our computers. We researched the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. Also, kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it. This is teaching them hand-eye coordiantion, and how to type. The computer is not @CAPS5 used for just communication. It's a good way to educate everyone although the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information. \"@CAPS6 and adults often check their e-mail and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy, \"says expert @PERSON1. I think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what's going on in our town, state, country, and world. For example, it can tell us about the series of shootings goiong on throughout @LOCATION1 or the many house robberies in our town. Us, @CAPS7 citizens, wnt to know everything... for us to stay safe and notified on the latest. Another example is that I logged on the computer three dats ago and it notified me about the earthquake in @LOCATION2. But there are so many benefits of a computer. The effects computers have on people are beneficial. It allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news. I think you should take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",

Your thesis is articulated well, highlighting the benefits of communication, education, and quick access to important information. Here are some specific areas where your essay excels and areas for improvement:\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Emotional Connection and Personal Experience:** Your essay does a great job of integrating personal anecdotes, such as staying in touch with your friend who moved away. This personal touch adds emotional depth to your argument and helps readers connect with your perspective. Your story about researching different aspects of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 in class further personalizes your points and makes the benefits of computers tangible for the reader.\n\n2. **Clarity and Organization:** The essay is well-organized with a clear introduction, body paragraphs that each focus on a specific benefit of computer use, and a conclusion that succinctly summarizes your main points. This logical flow enhances the readability and impact of your writing.\n\n3. **Expressive Language:** You use varied sentence structures and expressive vocabulary effectively, which keeps the reader engaged. Phrases like \"stay in touch,\" \"easily contact an old friend,\" and \"stay up to date with the latest local and global news\" resonate emotionally and underscore the benefits of computer use.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Detail and Specificity:** While your essay includes strong personal anecdotes, some points could benefit from more detailed support. For example, when discussing the educational benefits, you might add specific examples of how computers have helped you or your classmates improve skills or complete projects more efficiently.\n\n2. **Word Choice and Consistency:** There are a few instances where word choice could be more precise. For instance, instead of \"infromation,\" use \"information,\" and \"coordiantion\" should be \"coordination.\" Ensuring accurate spelling and grammar will strengthen your argument and enhance readability.\n\n3. **Emotional Resonance:** While your points are clear, delving deeper into the emotional nuances of your experiences could make your essay even more impactful. For instance, you might describe how it felt to stay connected with your friend who moved away\u2014what emotions did you experience, and how did using the computer help mitigate those feelings?\n\n4. **Transitions:** While your essay is well-organized overall, smoother transitions between paragraphs could further enhance the flow. Phrases that bridge one idea to the next can help maintain a seamless narrative and keep the reader engaged.\n\n5. **Conventions:** Pay attention to minor grammatical and typographical errors, such as \"goiong\" instead of \"going,\" and ensure proper capitalization. These small corrections will improve the overall polish of your essay.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOverall, your essay provides a compelling argument for the benefits of computers, enriched by personal experiences that make your points relatable and engaging. By focusing on more detailed support, refining word choice and",

        "textSelection": "I believe the current way materials are censored and removed works, and should continue. While everyone @MONTH1 dislike a particular novel or book, libraries can not remove every book a person dislikes, as Katherine Paterson said. When a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it, then the book usually is taken off of the shelves.     The possibility children will see the offensve material appears unlikely. Most public libraries do not put their offensive material near the childrens books. At my local library, their is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place. To acquire these books you must have a parents permission or be @NUM1 years of age. It is very unlikely a child would ever see the materials in question.     Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated. @PERSON3 @PERSON2 @MONTH1 have had racial slurs in it, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were normal for the time. Someone can not be frustrated with a novel written @NUM2 years ago because it has something offensive in it by todays standards.     While I believe, for the most part, libraries should not censor or remove materials, there should be some restrictions set in place to keep extremely harmful materials out of libraries. For instance, libraries should not have dirty magazines or movies on their shelves. If a high majority of people want a particular material banned, then it is hard to ignore them. When a book is so vulgar people begin to protest the book, there are questions as to whether the book should remain on library shelves. When a high percentage of people join that cause, then it should be banned.     Censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today. I believe the current system in place to censor or remove books does its job, and that it should continue. If few people disapprove of a particular material, the book remains in most shelves uncensored. When a lot of people begin to protest that same material, it has a high probability of being banned. With this process, every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not removed, while the ones that truly deserve it are removed.",

While everyone @MONTH1 dislike a particular novel or book, libraries can not remove every book a person dislikes, as Katherine Paterson said. When a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it, then the book usually is taken off of the shelves.     The possibility children will see the offensve material appears unlikely. Most public libraries do not put their offensive material near the childrens books. At my local library, their is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place. To acquire these books you must have a parents permission or be @NUM1 years of age. It is very unlikely a child would ever see the materials in question.     Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated. @PERSON3 @PERSON2 @MONTH1 have had racial slurs in it, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were normal for the time. Someone can not be frustrated with a novel written @NUM2 years ago because it has something offensive in it by todays standards.     While I believe, for the most part, libraries should not censor or remove materials, there should be some restrictions set in place to keep extremely harmful materials out of libraries. For instance, libraries should not have dirty magazines or movies on their shelves. If a high majority of people want a particular material banned, then it is hard to ignore them. When a book is so vulgar people begin to protest the book, there are questions as to whether the book should remain on library shelves. When a high percentage of people join that cause, then it should be banned.     Censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today. I believe the current system in place to censor or remove books does its job, and that it should continue. If few people disapprove of a particular material, the book remains in most shelves uncensored. When a lot of people begin to protest that same material, it has a high probability of being banned. With this process, every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not removed, while the ones that truly deserve it are removed.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Your essay presents a thoughtful perspective on censorship in libraries, emphasizing a balanced approach to maintaining freedom of access while considering public sentiment. You've done a commendable job in articulating your main argument, and your inclusion of personal observations, such as the organization of your local library, adds an authentic touch to your narrative.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Clear Thesis and Well-Defined Stance:** Your position on the current system of censorship is clearly stated, and you maintain this stance consistently throughout the essay. This clarity helps the reader understand your viewpoint from the outset.\n\n2. **Use of Personal Observations:** Including specific details about your local library's organization enhances the essay's authenticity and makes your argument more relatable and tangible.\n\n3. **Historical Context:** You effectively address the importance of considering the time and place of a story's origin when evaluating offensive content. This insight demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the subject matter.\n\n4. **Balanced Argument:** Your acknowledgment of the need for some level of restriction, particularly regarding extremely harmful materials, shows a balanced approach to the topic, adding credibility to your argument.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Emotional Resonance and Expressiveness:** While your essay is logically sound, it could benefit from more emotional depth to truly engage the reader. Consider sharing a personal anecdote or a vivid description that conveys your feelings about the importance of access to diverse materials in libraries. This would enhance the emotional impact of your writing.\n\n2. **Transitions and Flow:** The flow between paragraphs could be smoother. Try using more varied transitional phrases to guide the reader seamlessly from one point to the next. This will improve the overall coherence and readability of your essay.\n\n3. **Varied Sentence Structures:** While your sentences are generally clear, incorporating more varied sentence structures could add rhythm and energy to your writing. Experiment with combining shorter, impactful sentences with longer, more descriptive ones to create a more engaging narrative.\n\n4. **Word Choice:** Some of your word choices could be more precise and evocative to better capture the reader's attention. For instance, instead of \"the book usually is taken off of the shelves,\" you could say \"the book is often removed from the shelves.\" Small changes like this can make your writing more vivid and impactful.\n\n5. **Concluding Thoughts:** Your conclusion reiterates your main points well, but it could be strengthened by offering a compelling closing thought or call to action. Encourage the reader to reflect on their own views about censorship or suggest a specific way to engage with the issue.\n\n**Specific Feedback:**\n\n- **Offensive Material Placement:** The sentence \"At my local library, their is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place\" contains a typo. \"Their\" should be \"there.\" Additionally, consider using more descriptive language here to paint a clearer picture of this section in the reader's mind.\n\n- **Historical Context Paragraph:** The names and details in the sentence \"@PERSON3 @PERSON2 @MONTH",

Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.\n\n----- UPDATED TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is the updated profile of the teacher.\n\nThe teacher's highest priority in their class is to cultivate a deep emotional connection between students and their writing, believing that tapping into personal experiences and conveying emotions through evocative language and expressive storytelling not only enhances writing skills but also fosters self-awareness and empathy. Their teaching style is rooted in creating a supportive and encouraging environment where writing is viewed as an emotional journey. They provide detailed, constructive feedback that goes beyond technical aspects to focus on emotional expressiveness, clarity, and impact. \n\nIn their interactions with students, they emphasize open communication and active listening, encouraging the sharing of personal stories and emotions to build trust and comfort in exploring and expressing feelings through writing. One-on-one sessions are offered to provide personalized guidance, enhancing the emotional connection and expressive language in students' work.\n\nLessons are structured to build a strong foundation in emotional expressiveness and effective organization, using engaging introductions, thoughtful transitions, and examples of emotive vocabulary and varied sentence structures. The teacher is particularly attentive to ensuring that students develop their thesis statements and central ideas in a way that resonates emotionally, urging them to delve deeper into their personal experiences and the emotional nuances of their subjects. They encourage students to use vivid anecdotes and detailed descriptions to enrich their narratives.\n\nThe teacher's feedback is thorough and multifaceted, addressing both strengths and areas for improvement. They highlight the importance of emotional depth and provide specific suggestions for enhancing emotional resonance, coherence, and flow. Feedback often includes recommendations for improving word choice, sentence structure, and expressiveness to create a more engaging and impactful narrative. The teacher also emphasizes grammatical accuracy and the elimination of repetitive language to improve readability and emotional impact.\n\nOverall, the teacher's holistic and personalized approach aims to help students improve their writing skills while connecting deeply with their emotions and experiences, making their written work resonate powerfully with readers. They strive to create an environment where students feel empowered to express their innermost thoughts and feelings through their writing, fostering both personal growth and academic success.\n\n\n\n----- FEEDBACK -----\nHere are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The setting desented in the story, \u0093Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,\u0094 would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer\u0092s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, \u0093wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke\u0094 (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the setting and its effect on the cyclist but lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The inclusion of specific examples, such as the intense heat and dehydration the cyclist experienced, provides some support to the points made. However, the response often strays from a clear focus on the emotional and physical impact of the setting on the cyclist. The language used is somewhat repetitive and lacks variety, making the reading experience less engaging. Additionally, there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as \"desented\" instead of \"deserted\" and \"sorroundings\" instead of \"surroundings,\" which detract from the overall readability. While the narrative does include some transitional phrases, the flow is disjointed, and the essay fails to maintain a strong emotional connection with the reader. Further development of the central idea and emotional resonance would improve the essay significantly.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead.

The narrator tried the test once and failed. She bought herself a flower to cheer herself up. Her mother talked to her and then she felt better. She felt determined to pass the driving test just like the flower was determined to survive.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic recounting of the narrator's journey with the driving test and includes some emotional elements, such as the narrator's initial failure and their interaction with their mother. However, it falls short in terms of depth and emotional resonance. The essay lacks specific personal anecdotes and vivid emotional appeals that would make the narrative more engaging and impactful. The connection between the flower and the narrator's determination is not fully fleshed out, leaving the reader wanting more insight into the narrator's feelings and motivations. Additionally, the structure of the essay is quite simplistic, with a series of events listed without much coherence or fluid transitions, which detracts from the overall flow. The language used is basic and does not capture the emotional intensity or expressiveness expected in a high-scoring essay. While there are minimal grammatical errors, the vocabulary is limited and repetitive, which affects the overall readability and engagement. To improve, the essay should include more detailed personal stories, stronger emotional appeals, and varied, expressive language to create a more compelling narrative.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

No, a better piece \nof advice for the solo cyclist would be, \u201cNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers \nwho haven\u2019t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.\u201d It\u2019s not that a group of \nold guys doesn\u2019t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid \nplace. Things change. \nAt a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer \nevening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn\u2019t have done was \nlet them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice \nand launched out at first light along a \u201cshortcut\u201d that was to slice away hours from my ride to \nYosemite National Park. \nThey\u2019d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I \nwould come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with \nstrong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first \u201ctown.\u201d \nThis place might have been a thriving little spot at one time\u2014say, before the last world war\u2014but \non that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water \nsupply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool \npines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. \nTwenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, \nand a corral that couldn\u2019t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had \nbeen hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of \nCalifornia in June. \nI got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my \nstrength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the \nneighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water \nwouldn\u2019t cool down. It didn\u2019t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. \nThe old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make \nthat!

I began breaking the ride \ndown into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I\u2019d \nbe fine. \nOver one long, crippling hill, a building came into view.

        "llmResponse": "Thank you for sharing your essay with me. Your effort in addressing how the setting affects the cyclist in Joe Kurmaskie's \"Rough Road Ahead\" is appreciated. Let's delve deeper into both the strengths of your piece and where we can enhance emotional expressiveness and clarity.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Content Understanding:** You've chosen relevant aspects of the setting (the desert, ghost town, water pump) that significantly impact the cyclist's experience. This shows you have a good grasp of the story's main events.\n2. **Prompt Adherence:** Your response stays on topic and connects the setting with the cyclist's emotions and decisions, which is key to addressing the prompt.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n1. **Emotional Depth and Expressiveness:** To create a stronger emotional connection, try to include more vivid descriptions and personal reflections from the cyclist's perspective. For example, instead of just stating that \"his hope was dwindling,\" delve into the emotions he might have felt: \"With each passing mile, the oppressive heat and barren landscape seemed to sap not just his strength, but his very will to continue, leaving him feeling utterly defeated and alone.\"\n\n2. **Clarity and Flow:** Your sentences often contain multiple ideas that could be separated for better clarity. For instance, rewriting \"He found a water pump that produced a tar like substance as a result the desert and the lack of water made him wish he was dead\" into more distinct sentences would help: \"He found a water pump, but it only produced a tar-like substance. The harsh conditions of the desert and his lack of water made him feel desperate, even wishing for death.\"\n\n3. **Grammatical Accuracy:** Pay attention to grammar and spelling to ensure your essay reads smoothly. For instance:\n   - \"rough raod\" should be \"Rough Road\"\n   - \"he water supply was emicated\" should be \"his water supply was depleted\"\n   - \"he decided never to take advice from strangers and to trust his map\" can be more nuanced by saying, \"he vowed never to trust strangers' advice again and to always rely on his own map.\"\n\n4. **Detailed Descriptions:** Adding more specific examples and sensory details can enhance the narrative's impact. Describe the oppressive heat, the parched landscape, and the cyclist's physical and emotional state in more detail: \"The relentless sun beat down on him, causing wide rings of dried sweat to form on his shirt. Each pedal stroke felt heavier, his mouth parched, and his vision blurred with mirages.\"\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- **Vivid Anecdotes:** Include more detailed anecdotes from the text. For instance, describe the moment he stumbled upon Gary and Wilber\u2019s Fish Camp and the relief he felt when he finally found water.\n- **Expressive Language:** Use more varied and emotive vocabulary to convey the cyclist's despair and eventual relief. Words like \"oppressive,\" \"desolate,\" \"agonizing,\" and",

Provide feedback that is aligned with the teacher's style and the class needs. Use all of the information at your disposable to customize to the teacher and class. Take the teacher instruction into account, in case they emphasize specifically what they want you to do.\n\n---------------------------\n\n----- TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is a persona of the teacher. Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.\n\n----- UPDATED TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is the updated profile of the teacher.\n\nThe teacher's highest priority in their class is to cultivate a deep emotional connection between students and their writing, believing that tapping into personal experiences and conveying emotions through evocative language and expressive storytelling not only enhances writing skills but also fosters self-awareness and empathy. Their teaching style is rooted in creating a supportive and encouraging environment where writing is viewed as an emotional journey. They provide detailed, constructive feedback that goes beyond technical aspects to focus on emotional expressiveness, clarity, and impact. \n\nIn their interactions with students, they emphasize open communication and active listening, encouraging the sharing of personal stories and emotions to build trust and comfort in exploring and expressing feelings through writing. One-on-one sessions are offered to provide personalized guidance, enhancing the emotional connection and expressive language in students' work.\n\nLessons are structured to build a strong foundation in emotional expressiveness and effective organization, using engaging introductions, thoughtful transitions, and examples of emotive vocabulary and varied sentence structures. The teacher is particularly attentive to ensuring that students develop their thesis statements and central ideas in a way that resonates emotionally, urging them to delve deeper into their personal experiences and the emotional nuances of their subjects. They encourage students to use vivid anecdotes and detailed descriptions to enrich their narratives.\n\nThe teacher's feedback is thorough and multifaceted, addressing both strengths and areas for improvement. They highlight the importance of emotional depth and provide specific suggestions for enhancing emotional resonance, coherence, and flow. Feedback often includes recommendations for improving word choice, sentence structure, and expressiveness to create a more engaging and impactful narrative. The teacher also emphasizes grammatical accuracy and the elimination of repetitive language to improve readability and emotional impact.\n\nOverall, the teacher's holistic and personalized approach aims to help students improve their writing skills while connecting deeply with their emotions and experiences, making their written work resonate powerfully with readers. They strive to create an environment where students feel empowered to express their innermost thoughts and feelings through their writing, fostering both personal growth and academic success.\n\n\n\n----- FEEDBACK -----\nHere are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The setting desented in the story, \u0093Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,\u0094 would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer\u0092s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, \u0093wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke\u0094 (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the setting and its effect on the cyclist but lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The inclusion of specific examples, such as the intense heat and dehydration the cyclist experienced, provides some support to the points made. However, the response often strays from a clear focus on the emotional and physical impact of the setting on the cyclist. The language used is somewhat repetitive and lacks variety, making the reading experience less engaging. Additionally, there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as \"desented\" instead of \"deserted\" and \"sorroundings\" instead of \"surroundings,\" which detract from the overall readability. While the narrative does include some transitional phrases, the flow is disjointed, and the essay fails to maintain a strong emotional connection with the reader. Further development of the central idea and emotional resonance would improve the essay significantly.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead.

This shows that the author is trying to focus your attention on the culture of the @CAPS1 and that the house was relaxed and calm which is the tone of the author.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay delves into the emotional and cultural elements of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, effectively highlighting the significance of Cuban culture and familial bonds. However, the clarity of your thesis statement could be enhanced to better convey the emotional impact and central theme of your analysis. While you include some personal stories and quotes from the memoir, the arguments would benefit from more in-depth development and additional supporting evidence to make a stronger emotional appeal. The organizational structure is somewhat present, but the transitions between paragraphs need to be smoother to ensure a logical flow that enhances the emotional impact. In terms of language and style, your essay shows some variety in vocabulary and sentence structures, but there are areas where word choice and expressiveness could be improved to better capture the emotional nuances of the memoir. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall readability and impact of your writing. To improve, focus on creating a more emotionally resonant thesis, developing your arguments with richer anecdotes and emotional appeals, and refining your language for greater expressiveness and grammatical accuracy.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

No, a better piece \nof advice for the solo cyclist would be, \u201cNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers \nwho haven\u2019t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.\u201d It\u2019s not that a group of \nold guys doesn\u2019t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid \nplace. Things change. \nAt a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer \nevening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn\u2019t have done was \nlet them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice \nand launched out at first light along a \u201cshortcut\u201d that was to slice away hours from my ride to \nYosemite National Park. \nThey\u2019d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I \nwould come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with \nstrong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first \u201ctown.\u201d \nThis place might have been a thriving little spot at one time\u2014say, before the last world war\u2014but \non that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water \nsupply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool \npines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. \nTwenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, \nand a corral that couldn\u2019t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had \nbeen hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of \nCalifornia in June. \nI got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my \nstrength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the \nneighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water \nwouldn\u2019t cool down. It didn\u2019t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. \nThe old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make \nthat! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so\u2014a test of my inner spirit. \nNot two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.

        "llmResponse": "Thank you for your effort in identifying how the setting impacted the cyclist in Joe Kurmaskie's narrative. Your essay touches on some crucial elements such as the heat of the desert, the abandoned towns, and the cyclist's limited water supply. These are excellent starting points that can be further expanded to create a more vivid and emotionally resonant narrative.\n\nTo enhance the emotional connection and impact of your writing, consider delving deeper into the cyclist\u2019s experiences and emotions. For instance, instead of simply stating, \"The month was June a hot month and the sun was beating down on him,\" you could describe the physical and emotional toll the heat took on him. How did the relentless sun make him feel? Did it evoke a sense of desperation, frustration, or perhaps even a moment of hopelessness? Adding such reflections can help the reader connect more deeply with the cyclist's ordeal.\n\nYour essay would also benefit from more varied sentence structures and emotive vocabulary. For example, instead of \"he was riding in the desert,\" you could say, \"he pedaled through the unforgiving desert, each mile feeling like an endless test of endurance.\" This paints a more vivid picture and conveys the emotional weight of his journey.\n\nAdditionally, consider providing more specific examples from the text to support your points. When you mention the abandoned towns, you could include details about the ghostly remnants of civilization the cyclist encountered, such as the rusted pumps and the eerie silence that amplified his isolation and vulnerability. These details not only support your analysis but also enrich the narrative.\n\nIn terms of organization, ensure your essay flows smoothly by using transitional phrases to connect your thoughts. For example, you might say, \"As the sun reached its zenith, the cyclist's struggle intensified, battling not only the scorching heat but also the psychological impact of seeing one abandoned town after another.\"\n\nFinally, pay close attention to grammatical accuracy and eliminate repetitive language. This will improve the readability and overall impact of your essay.\n\nOverall, your essay has a solid foundation. By incorporating more emotional depth, varied language, and detailed examples, you can create a more compelling and impactful narrative that resonates with your readers. Keep exploring the emotional nuances of your subjects, and you'll continue to grow as a writer. Great job so far, and I look forward to seeing your revisions!",

Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion about what the book is convincing readers?     I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self. But if I have the right to remove that book from the self- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the self for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from the arthur, Katherine Paterson, from my opinion, I believe that what she is saying is very true. Considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things, if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the self, there would not be a varity of books for people to choose from. I have sometimes gotten corious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book. They either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible. Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good. So if they had the right to remove that book I would have never got the chance to read that book.     I do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelfs just on their specific personality. Everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books. Everyone should get a large variety",

Provide feedback that is aligned with the teacher's style and the class needs. Use all of the information at your disposable to customize to the teacher and class. Take the teacher instruction into account, in case they emphasize specifically what they want you to do.\n\n---------------------------\n\n----- TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is a persona of the teacher. Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.\n\n----- UPDATED TEACHER PERSONA -----\nAs a teacher who prioritizes grammatical accuracy and adherence to language conventions, my most high-priority goal is to ensure that each student's writing demonstrates a strong command of grammar and language conventions. This includes crafting clear and grammatically correct thesis statements, developing well-supported arguments with precise sentences, and concluding effectively. I aim for students to create essays with clear and logically structured paragraphs, utilizing varied and accurate vocabulary while maintaining grammatical precision, correct spelling, punctuation, and capitalization throughout their work.\n\nMy overall teaching style is centered around precision, clarity, and adherence to language conventions. I provide detailed and constructive feedback that focuses on grammatical accuracy and the development of clear, logically structured arguments. By highlighting specific areas for improvement, I help students understand their mistakes and make meaningful progress. When interacting with students, I emphasize the importance of clear communication and encourage them to ask questions whenever they encounter difficulties.\n\nMy feedback is thorough and aimed at helping students refine their writing skills, ensuring they grasp the nuances of grammar, syntax, and proper usage. I also make it a point to praise correct usage and well-structured arguments, reinforcing positive learning experiences. When reviewing student work, I assess the clarity of their thesis statements, the coherence and relevance of their supporting details, and the precision of their language. Essays that exhibit weak organization, fragmented sentences, or insufficient content development receive specific guidance on how to improve these areas.\n\nI focus not only on identifying errors but also on providing concrete suggestions for enhancement, such as refining vocabulary or restructuring paragraphs for better flow. For strong essays, I commend the logical flow, varied word choice, and adherence to writing conventions, noting how these elements contribute to the overall effectiveness of the piece.\n\nIn summary, my teaching approach is methodical and supportive, aiming to enhance students' mastery of the English language through consistent and precise feedback, clear instructions, and an open channel for questions and discussions. By maintaining high standards and providing constructive and specific feedback, I strive to help students become confident and skilled writers.\n\n\n\n----- FEEDBACK -----\nHere are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: everyone to remove objects from the libraries just cause some other people find it offensive.

Your main idea is clear, but the essay lacks sufficient supporting details and examples, which makes the argument less compelling. The organization of your essay could be improved, as it transitions abruptly between ideas and lacks a clear, logical flow. For instance, the paragraphs could be better structured to support your thesis effectively. The word choice is often imprecise and informal, such as \"ext.\" instead of \"etc.\" and \"do to\" instead of \"due to.\" Additionally, there are several grammatical errors, including issues with sentence structure, spelling, and punctuation, which detract from the readability and overall impact of the essay. To enhance clarity and effectiveness, ensure that each sentence is grammatically correct and that transitions between paragraphs are smooth. Lastly, refining your vocabulary and sentence structures will help to articulate your arguments more convincingly and maintain the reader's interest throughout.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Do I belive that some books, movies, magazines, or ext., shuold be removed do to the fuct some people might find them offensive?

Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion about what the book is convincing readers?     I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self. But if I have the right to remove that book from the self- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the self for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from the arthur, Katherine Paterson, from my opinion, I believe that what she is saying is very true. Considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things, if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the self, there would not be a varity of books for people to choose from. I have sometimes gotten corious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book. They either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible. Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good. So if they had the right to remove that book I would have never got the chance to read that book.     I do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelfs just on their specific personality. Everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books. Everyone should get a large variety\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Thank you for your effort in addressing the topic of censorship in libraries. Your main idea is clear, and you have made a good start by incorporating a quote from Katherine Paterson, which strengthens your argument. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved to enhance clarity, coherence, and overall impact.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis statement could be more precise and assertive. Instead of asking questions in the opening sentences, try to clearly state your position and what you intend to argue. For example, \"Books should not be removed from public libraries solely based on individual opinions, as this would limit the diversity of ideas and perspectives available to readers.\"\n\n2. **Organization**: While you have included relevant examples, the organization of your essay needs improvement. Your paragraphs should be structured to support your thesis more effectively. Ensure each paragraph transitions smoothly to the next. For instance, your anecdote about asking friends about books could be better integrated into a paragraph that discusses the subjective nature of opinions.\n\n3. **Word Choice**: There are several instances where word choice could be improved for clarity and professionalism. For example, \"bookselfs\" should be \"bookshelves,\" \"self\" should be \"shelf,\" and \"arthur\" should be \"author.\" Additionally, phrases like \"specific personality\" could be rephrased for clarity\u2014perhaps to \"individual preferences.\"\n\n4. **Sentence Fluency**: Some sentences are awkwardly constructed and could benefit from revision for better flow. For example, \"Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good\" could be rewritten as \"After reading a few pages myself, I found it quite enjoyable.\" Ensure that your sentences vary in structure and length to maintain the reader's interest.\n\n5. **Grammar and Conventions**: There are several grammatical errors, including issues with punctuation, spelling, and capitalization. For instance, \"corious\" should be \"curious,\" \"varity\" should be \"variety,\" and \"self\" should be \"shelf.\" Also, ensure that quotes are correctly attributed and punctuated.\n\n6. **Supporting Details**: While you provide some examples, your arguments would benefit from more supporting details and examples to make them more compelling. Consider including specific instances where censorship has led to a loss of important information or diverse viewpoints.\n\n7. **Concluding Sentence**: Your concluding paragraph should effectively summarize your main points and reinforce your thesis. Currently, it ends abruptly. Consider crafting a conclusion that restates your position and emphasizes the importance of maintaining a diverse collection of books in libraries.\n\n8. **Quote Integration**: Integrate the Katherine Paterson quote more seamlessly into your argument. Explain its relevance and how it supports your position.\n\nHere\u2019s a revised version of your introduction and first paragraph to illustrate these suggestions:\n\n**Revised Introduction and First Paragraph**:\n\"Books should not be removed from public libraries solely based on individual opinions, as this would limit",

Certion books young children should not read because they have sex in them and they talk about things that a child should not even be thinking about at that age.When children read books like that they tend to think about sex and how what they read about will feel but children should not be thinking about that type of stuff that why its there parent's responseabitly to montoir what there children read because that there job as parent's to do not the person who wrote the book because they @MONTH1 think there writing to a much older group that can relate to what there talking about but then again there just speacking there mind and infourceing there freedom of speach right one of the rights that we as a people together have been fighting for .I also feel that music help's us to express are selfs so if someone feels that the music is inapprotive for there child then they need to watch what there child is listen to.Music brings out the different moods in every body.All magazines are not for every one because as we all know there are adult magazines the produce certion imagary that children should not see but you can not blame the creater only the buyer is in fault for leaving it in the wrong place after there done with it .There just people trying to make money  off things that they know that people like.",

Provide feedback that is aligned with the teacher's style and the class needs. Use all of the information at your disposable to customize to the teacher and class. Take the teacher instruction into account, in case they emphasize specifically what they want you to do.\n\n---------------------------\n\n----- TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is a persona of the teacher. Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.\n\n----- UPDATED TEACHER PERSONA -----\nAs a teacher who prioritizes grammatical accuracy and adherence to language conventions, my most high-priority goal is to ensure that each student's writing demonstrates a strong command of grammar and language conventions. This includes crafting clear and grammatically correct thesis statements, developing well-supported arguments with precise sentences, and concluding effectively. I aim for students to create essays with clear and logically structured paragraphs, utilizing varied and accurate vocabulary while maintaining grammatical precision, correct spelling, punctuation, and capitalization throughout their work.\n\nMy overall teaching style is centered around precision, clarity, and adherence to language conventions. I provide detailed and constructive feedback that focuses on grammatical accuracy and the development of clear, logically structured arguments. By highlighting specific areas for improvement, I help students understand their mistakes and make meaningful progress. When interacting with students, I emphasize the importance of clear communication and encourage them to ask questions whenever they encounter difficulties.\n\nMy feedback is thorough and aimed at helping students refine their writing skills, ensuring they grasp the nuances of grammar, syntax, and proper usage. I also make it a point to praise correct usage and well-structured arguments, reinforcing positive learning experiences. When reviewing student work, I assess the clarity of their thesis statements, the coherence and relevance of their supporting details, and the precision of their language. Essays that exhibit weak organization, fragmented sentences, or insufficient content development receive specific guidance on how to improve these areas.\n\nI focus not only on identifying errors but also on providing concrete suggestions for enhancement, such as refining vocabulary or restructuring paragraphs for better flow. For strong essays, I commend the logical flow, varied word choice, and adherence to writing conventions, noting how these elements contribute to the overall effectiveness of the piece.\n\nIn summary, my teaching approach is methodical and supportive, aiming to enhance students' mastery of the English language through consistent and precise feedback, clear instructions, and an open channel for questions and discussions. By maintaining high standards and providing constructive and specific feedback, I strive to help students become confident and skilled writers.\n\n\n\n----- FEEDBACK -----\nHere are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: doing drugs, and other various risky activities are okay? I know I sure wouldn't.     Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society. It can be found nearly anywhere. In books, magazines, @CAPS1 shows, movies, on the @CAPS2, you name it. All of these are easily accessible by children of all ages. That is why there should be censorship of certain materials, to a certain degree. By this, I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library, it should only be able to be\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay provides a compelling argument for the necessity of censorship to protect children from inappropriate content. The thesis is clear and grammatically correct, establishing a strong foundation for your viewpoint. The development of your argument is consistent, using grammatically precise sentences to emphasize the dangers of exposing young children to explicit material. The conclusion effectively reinforces the thesis, summarizing the key points made throughout the essay. The organization of the essay is commendable, with each paragraph logically flowing into the next, guided by clear and grammatically correct transitions and topic sentences. Your word choice is varied and appropriate, enhancing the persuasiveness of your argument. The complexity and correctness of your sentence structures further contribute to the overall readability and impact of the essay. Additionally, the essay demonstrates strong control of standard writing conventions, with minimal errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Overall, your writing is clear, focused, and engaging, adhering to grammatical conventions and displaying a logical and effective organization.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Have you ever watched or seen a book or even a movie that you do not think kids should be reading or watching? I have, heard of many books. There are even music out there that only adults should be listening too. There are some parents that are strick on what their kids watch, hear, read or sing. I know for a fact that my parents would not want me to be letting my childern read, watch or hear that kind of stuff.      When you think of the music, books, or movies that need to be out of childern\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents an understandable perspective on the importance of shielding children from inappropriate content in books, movies, and music. However, it suffers from several issues that impact its overall effectiveness. The clarity of the thesis could be improved, as it feels somewhat scattered and not grammatically polished. The arguments in support of the main idea are present but are overly simplistic and repetitive, lacking the depth and precise language needed to fully engage the reader. Additionally, the organization of the essay is quite weak, with paragraphs that do not follow a clear, logical structure and transitions that are often awkward or missing altogether. The word choice and sentence structures are basic and exhibit numerous grammatical errors, including spelling mistakes (\"childern,\" \"apporaite,\" \"differnet\") and incorrect usage of words. These issues detract from the readability and overall impact of the essay. Furthermore, the conclusion, while summarizing the main points, does not effectively synthesize the arguments to leave a lasting impression. Overall, while the essay's intent is clear, it requires significant refinement in clarity, grammatical accuracy, organization, and language use to meet the stated prioritization of grammatical precision and effective communication.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: kind of stuff.

However, several issues need addressing to enhance the overall effectiveness and clarity of your argument.\n\n1. **Thesis Clarity and Development:**\n   - Your argument is somewhat scattered and lacks a well-defined thesis. A clear thesis statement at the beginning will help you present a focused and compelling argument.\n   - Consider rephrasing your thesis to something like: \"Instead of removing offensive materials from shelves, we should implement a rating system to protect freedom of speech while ensuring content is appropriately accessed.\"\n\n2. **Grammar and Language Conventions:**\n   - There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the essay that hinder readability. For instance, \"thing should come with a rateing\" should be \"things should come with a rating.\"\n   - Ensure subject-verb agreement and proper tense usage. For example, \"To many people have faught\" should be \"Too many people have fought.\"\n   - Pay attention to spelling and punctuation. Words like \"speech,\" \"violence,\" \"profane,\" \"rating,\" \"inappropriate,\" and \"monitor\" are misspelled and need correction.\n   - Capitalization errors are frequent. For instance, \"freedom of speach\" should be \"freedom of speech,\" and \"I strongly belive that;That saying\" should be \"I strongly believe that; that saying.\"\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Fluency:**\n   - Sentence structures are often fragmented and lack fluidity. For example, \"That's like saying they should have taken @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 when it first came out off the market\" is unclear and needs rephrasing for clarity.\n   - Try to vary your sentence lengths and structures to enhance the flow of your writing.\n\n4. **Organization:**\n   - The essay lacks a clear organizational structure. Ensure each paragraph has a clear topic sentence and that your ideas flow logically from one to the next.\n   - Group related ideas together. Separate your arguments about books, music, and other media into distinct paragraphs with appropriate transitions.\n\n5. **Support and Development:**\n   - Your arguments need more specific, relevant examples and supporting details. For instance, when discussing the role of parents in monitoring content, provide more concrete examples or statistical data if possible.\n   - Avoid overly general statements and strive for depth in your argumentation.\n\n6. **Word Choice:**\n   - There are several instances of imprecise or incorrect word usage. For example, \"inapprotive\" should be \"inappropriate.\"\n   - Use more precise and varied vocabulary to enhance the persuasiveness of your argument.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n- **Rewrite the Introduction:** Clearly state your thesis and briefly outline your main points.\n- **Enhance Grammar and Conventions:** Proofread your work for grammatical errors, focusing on spelling, punctuation, and capitalization.",

By maintaining high standards and providing constructive and specific feedback, I strive to help students become confident and skilled writers.\n\n\n\n----- FEEDBACK -----\nHere are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The setting in \u0093Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,\u0094 affected the cyclist greatly. For starters it says he was \u0093traveling through the high desserts\u0094 which is never a safe thing. He had been drinking he water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was, \u0093trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state.\u0094 From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into \u0093A far like substance\u0094 The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay on the influence of the setting in \"Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit\" struggles significantly with clarity, coherence, and adherence to grammatical conventions. The thesis statement is vague and not clearly defined. The essay attempts to discuss how the setting affects the cyclist but lacks specific examples and detailed support from the text, resulting in a superficial response. Many sentences are grammatically incorrect or fragmented, which makes the narrative disjointed and difficult to follow. The organization is weak, with an unclear structure that lacks smooth transitions between ideas. There are numerous spelling and punctuation errors, which further impede readability. Overall, the essay fails to effectively communicate its points due to insufficient content development and weak language control. There is a need for a more structured approach, including a clear thesis, well-supported arguments, and a focus on grammatical accuracy to enhance the overall quality of the writing.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The features of the setting in the essay \u0093Do not exceed the posted speed limit\u0094 affected the cyclist in a negative way. The more and more he rode, he thought more negatively and had alot of doubt. The cyclist was not very confident, he thought he wouldn\u0092t make it. For example, when the cyclist notices nothing in sight, his tone changes. \u0093There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon telling\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic understanding of how the features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist, but it lacks depth and specificity in its analysis. The thesis is not entirely clear and could benefit from a more precise statement. The development of arguments includes some examples from the memoir, but these are not thoroughly analyzed or integrated into a cohesive argument. The writing demonstrates frequent grammatical errors, such as \"alot of doubt\" instead of \"a lot of doubt,\" and issues with sentence structure that impede readability. The organization shows potential but needs clearer, more grammatically correct transitions and topic sentences to enhance the logical flow. The language used is somewhat repetitive and lacks variety, which diminishes the overall impact. While the narrative does employ some transitional phrases, it could be more polished to ensure smoother transitions and a more engaging narrative. Overall, the essay could greatly benefit from a more focused thesis, detailed support from the text, and meticulous proofreading to address grammatical inaccuracies.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The features of the setting affect the cyclist because his body has a hard time adjusting to his life threating situation. The neat and desert atmosphere are draining his body of water, @CAPS1 he needs to keep pedaling on. Also, the terrain is stripped of water, so he doesn't have anything to refuel with.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to address the prompt by discussing how the setting affects the cyclist, but it falls short in several areas. The thesis statement is present but not clearly articulated, and the sentences contain numerous grammatical errors that detract from the overall clarity and readability. The development and support of arguments are weak, with limited evidence from the memoir to substantiate the points made. Additionally, the conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis. Organization is lacking as the essay jumps from one point to another without clear transitions or topic sentences, making it difficult to follow the narrative. The language and style are also problematic, with a limited vocabulary and repetitive sentence structures that do not enhance the essay's persuasiveness. There are significant errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization that further impede readability. Overall, the essay needs substantial improvement in grammatical precision, organization, and the use of supporting evidence to effectively communicate its message.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 3 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit \nby Joe Kurmaskie \nFORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece \nof advice for the solo cyclist would be, \u201cNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers \nwho haven\u2019t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.\u201d It\u2019s not that a group of \nold guys doesn\u2019t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid \nplace. Things change. \nAt a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer \nevening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn\u2019t have done was \nlet them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice \nand launched out at first light along a \u201cshortcut\u201d that was to slice away hours from my ride to \nYosemite National Park. \nThey\u2019d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I \nwould come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with \nstrong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first \u201ctown.\u201d \nThis place might have been a thriving little spot at one time\u2014say, before the last world war\u2014but \non that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water \nsupply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool \npines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. \nTwenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, \nand a corral that couldn\u2019t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had \nbeen hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of \nCalifornia in June. \nI got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my \nstrength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the \nneighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water \nwouldn\u2019t cool down. It didn\u2019t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. \nThe old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make \nthat! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so\u2014a test of my inner spirit. \nNot two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was \nreplaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign \njumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. \nThe speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so \ncruel. \nI toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake\u2014it \nreally did look like a diamondback\u2014blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased \npast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. \nThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my \nshirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June \nsimply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn\u2019t been off their porch in decades, \ncaused me to laugh. \nIt was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. \nThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride \ndown into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I\u2019d \nbe fine. \nOver one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make \nsure it wasn\u2019t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst \nof energy, I maneuvered down the hill. \nIn an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building\u2014abandoned years \nearlier, by the looks of it\u2014had been a Welch\u2019s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A \nsandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still \nbe seen. \nI hung my head. \nThat smoky blues tune \u201cSummertime\u201d rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating \nbrain. \nI got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. \nI\u2019d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you \nhave left to circulate. With any luck I\u2019d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. \nIt didn\u2019t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some \nexpensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and \ntheir keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I \nwas going to lose consciousness for the last time. \nSomehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining \nelevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear \nwere all behind me. \nGARY AND WILBER\u2019S FISH CAMP\u2014IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE\u2019RE \nYOUR BEST BET! \n\u201cAnd the only bet,\u201d I remember thinking. \nAs I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an \noverwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait\u2014any bait, even \nthough I didn\u2019t own a rod or reel. \nAn old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from \nmy head as I slumped against the wall beside him. \n\u201cWhere you headed in such a hurry?\u201d \n\u201cYosemite,\u201d I whispered. \n\u201cKnow the best way to get there?\u201d \nI watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group \nI\u2019d listened to in Lodi. \n\u201cYes, sir! I own a very good map.\u201d \nAnd I promised myself right then that I\u2019d always stick to it in the future. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-3-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 3 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nWrite a response that explains how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.

        "llmResponse": "The essay on how the setting affects the cyclist in \"Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit\" demonstrates a basic understanding of the narrative but requires significant improvement in clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement and Introduction:**\n   - The thesis statement is present but could be more precisely articulated. For example, \"The setting in 'Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit' significantly impacts the cyclist, primarily through its varied and challenging terrains.\" This would provide a clearer focus for the essay.\n\n2. **Content and Development:**\n   - The essay correctly identifies key aspects of the setting that affect the cyclist, such as the abandoned towns, rolling hills, and extreme heat. However, the analysis lacks depth. Specific examples from the text should be integrated more thoroughly to support your points. For instance, discuss how the cyclist's encounter with the \"tarlike substance\" from the water pump intensifies his struggle.\n   \n3. **Organization and Coherence:**\n   - The organization needs improvement to enhance logical flow. Each paragraph should start with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea. For example, \"The cyclist's journey begins optimistically but quickly deteriorates as he encounters the harsh realities of the abandoned towns.\" \n   - Ensure smooth transitions between ideas to maintain coherence. Phrases like \"Additionally,\" \"Furthermore,\" and \"In contrast\" can help link your arguments logically.\n\n4. **Language and Vocabulary:**\n   - The language used is fairly simple and repetitive. Try to incorporate a more varied vocabulary to enhance the essay's sophistication. For example, instead of \"totally abandoned,\" you might say \"completely desolate.\"\n   - Attention to grammatical accuracy is crucial. For instance, \"his working\" should be \"he is working,\" and \"diffrent\" should be \"different.\"\n   - Be mindful of parallel structure, especially in lists: \"rolling hills, tumbleweed rolling by, and a snake\" could be more effectively written as \"rolling hills, passing tumbleweeds, and a menacing snake.\"\n\n5. **Grammar and Mechanics:**\n   - There are several grammatical errors that need correction. Ensure subject-verb agreement, correct verb tenses, and proper punctuation. For example, \"He started out strong until he got to the first town, which was totally abandoned\" could be revised to \"He started out strong but encountered his first challenge upon reaching a completely desolate town.\"\n   - Proofread for spelling errors and capitalization issues.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion should effectively summarize the main points and restate the thesis in a new light. It currently feels abrupt and could be expanded to reinforce how the setting's features critically impacted the cyclist.\n\nOverall, your essay shows a promising grasp of the narrative's key events and their effects on the cyclist. With more precise articulation of the thesis, deeper analysis, improved organization, varied vocabulary, and meticulous attention to",

The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it\u0092s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she\u0092ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus \u0093comes back to life\u0092\u0092. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good she\u0092ll feel good\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic attempt to engage with the prompt, but it lacks clarity and depth. The thesis is not clearly stated, making it difficult for readers to understand the main argument. The development of ideas is minimal and somewhat confusing. For example, instead of explaining why the author concluded the story with a statement about a new beginning, the essay drifts into discussing various unrelated aspects. Grammatical errors such as \"about,\" \"is,\" \"desrves,\" and inconsistent verb tenses detract significantly from the readability and flow of the essay. Additionally, the sentence structures are not varied, and the vocabulary is simple and often used incorrectly, leading to a monotonous tone. The paragraph lacks proper transitions, making it disjointed and hard to follow. There is also a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points made, which weakens the overall argument. For future improvement, the writer should focus on crafting a clear thesis, using varied and precise language, and providing specific examples to support their arguments, all while maintaining grammatical accuracy.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succed, one must keep trying. Saeng will adapt to her new copiuntry in time but not if she spends heer time wishing to go back to her homeland. The hibiscus is a reminder to hers of starting a new and adapting to society. Saeng will retry her driver\u0092s test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided lacks clarity and is fraught with grammatical errors, which significantly impede its readability and effectiveness. The thesis statement is somewhat unclear, and the supporting sentences contain numerous mistakes, reducing the impact of the arguments presented. Consequently, the essay does not adequately address the prompt, nor does it remain focused on any coherent argument about Saeng's adaptation to her new country. The sentences are often incomplete or awkwardly structured, further detracting from the essay's overall readability. Additionally, the essay lacks a logical flow, with transitions that are neither smooth nor grammatically correct. The conclusion is abrupt and fails to effectively summarize the thesis, leaving the reader with an incomplete understanding of the author's main points. Improvements in grammatical accuracy, clearer thesis articulation, better organizational structure, and more precise language usage are needed to enhance the quality and coherence of this essay.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

As Saeng\nwalks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist\nshop to see if the plant can be purchased. \nIt was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery.

Saeng felt a shock of\nrecognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \n\u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. \nA saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with\nvermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into\nthe well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the\nbucket. \nSlowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,\noleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had\nnot even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. \nWhen she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and\ncool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. \nAnd beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with\npurplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to\nsee it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick\nwalls or between tiled roofs. \nAnd that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and\nfound a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.\n\u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said,\nsavoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its\ntag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d \nOne of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed\nher eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could\nalmost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she\ncombed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng\nwould help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. \nSaeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm\naround it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed\ncomb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? \nA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a\nchannel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. \nAnd in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. \nIt was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the\nlast remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.\nAs if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of\nthe onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to\nher. \nHer smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully.\n\u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed\nthe potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. \nMrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere\ndid you get it?\u201d \n\u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \n\u201cHow much?\u201d \nFor answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the \nLambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \n\u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \n\u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \n\u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this\nvegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed\nthe tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \n\u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. \nFor a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the\neye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. \nHer mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful\nplant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \n\u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the\nwords at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t\nas pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.\nThat\u2019s what matters.\u201d \nShe tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her\nother hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d \nShe went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The\nsoil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair\ntrailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There\nwas a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \n\u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. \nMrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and\nstart dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. \nLeft alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it.\nShe could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,\nthe sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth\nwatered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not\neven Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.\nBut she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. \nThe \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.\nOverhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng\nnow. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange\nbefore had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her\nnow. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against\nthe evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. \nWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the\ngeese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-4-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 4 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nRead the last paragraph of the story. \n\"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and\nthe geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.\" \nWrite a response that explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.

She failed the test but wants to take it again. Her grandmother's resemblance is in the flower so if the flower budds, then her grandmother will be back in a sense. When he grandmother \"comes back\" then @PERSON1 will feel as if her grandmother is giving her strength and encouragement to try the test again.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Your essay begins with a clear reference to the story \"Winter Hibiscus\" and the concluding quote, which is commendable. However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to meet the high standards of grammatical accuracy and coherent argumentation that we aim for in this class.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis statement is somewhat unclear and lacks grammatical precision. For instance, the sentence \"the auther put this paragraph as the concluding thought to stress that Saeng is determined to make a change\" could be more effectively written as \"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's determination to change.\"\n\n2. **Grammatical Errors**: There are several grammatical errors throughout your essay. For example, \"auther\" should be \"author,\" and \"budds\" should be \"buds.\" Additionally, \"Saeng's vowed silently to herself\" should be \"Saeng vowed silently to herself.\" Attention to detail is crucial, so please proofread your work to catch these errors.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure**: The sentence structure is often awkward and lacks coherence. For example, \"When he grandmother 'comes back' then @PERSON1 will feel as if her grandmother is giving her strength and encouragement to try the test again\" is unclear and confusing. It would be more effective to write, \"When her grandmother 'comes back' through the blooming flower, Saeng feels as if her grandmother is encouraging her to try the test again.\"\n\n4. **Supporting Details**: While you provide some reasoning for why the author concludes the story with this paragraph, your arguments need stronger support from the text. For instance, you could elaborate more on Saeng's relationship with her grandmother and how it is symbolized by the hibiscus.\n\n5. **Language and Vocabulary**: Your vocabulary is somewhat limited and repetitive. Try to use a wider range of words to make your essay more engaging. For instance, instead of repeating \"take the test again,\" you could use variations like \"retry the test\" or \"attempt the test once more.\"\n\n6. **Transitions**: Your essay lacks smooth transitions between ideas, making it feel disjointed. Use transitional phrases to connect your thoughts more fluidly. For example, you could write, \"Furthermore, the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng's hope and resilience, reminding her of her grandmother's guidance.\"\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion needs to effectively summarize your main points and tie back to your thesis. Currently, it feels abrupt and incomplete. Consider rewriting it to reinforce the idea that the hibiscus and the memory of her grandmother give Saeng the strength to try again.\n\nIn summary, focus on improving grammatical accuracy, refining your thesis statement, elaborating on your supporting details, varying your vocabulary, and enhancing the overall flow of your essay. With these improvements, your writing will become more precise and impactful. Keep working hard, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you need further clarification.",

Provide feedback that is aligned with the teacher's style and the class needs. Use all of the information at your disposable to customize to the teacher and class. Take the teacher instruction into account, in case they emphasize specifically what they want you to do.\n\n---------------------------\n\n----- TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is a persona of the teacher. Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.\n\n----- UPDATED TEACHER PERSONA -----\nAs a teacher who prioritizes grammatical accuracy and adherence to language conventions, my most high-priority goal is to ensure that each student's writing demonstrates a strong command of grammar and language conventions. This includes crafting clear and grammatically correct thesis statements, developing well-supported arguments with precise sentences, and concluding effectively. I aim for students to create essays with clear and logically structured paragraphs, utilizing varied and accurate vocabulary while maintaining grammatical precision, correct spelling, punctuation, and capitalization throughout their work.\n\nMy overall teaching style is centered around precision, clarity, and adherence to language conventions. I provide detailed and constructive feedback that focuses on grammatical accuracy and the development of clear, logically structured arguments. By highlighting specific areas for improvement, I help students understand their mistakes and make meaningful progress. When interacting with students, I emphasize the importance of clear communication and encourage them to ask questions whenever they encounter difficulties.\n\nMy feedback is thorough and aimed at helping students refine their writing skills, ensuring they grasp the nuances of grammar, syntax, and proper usage. I also make it a point to praise correct usage and well-structured arguments, reinforcing positive learning experiences. When reviewing student work, I assess the clarity of their thesis statements, the coherence and relevance of their supporting details, and the precision of their language. Essays that exhibit weak organization, fragmented sentences, or insufficient content development receive specific guidance on how to improve these areas.\n\nI focus not only on identifying errors but also on providing concrete suggestions for enhancement, such as refining vocabulary or restructuring paragraphs for better flow. For strong essays, I commend the logical flow, varied word choice, and adherence to writing conventions, noting how these elements contribute to the overall effectiveness of the piece.\n\nIn summary, my teaching approach is methodical and supportive, aiming to enhance students' mastery of the English language through consistent and precise feedback, clear instructions, and an open channel for questions and discussions. By maintaining high standards and providing constructive and specific feedback, I strive to help students become confident and skilled writers.\n\n\n\n----- FEEDBACK -----\nHere are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memoreies of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring. This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The concluding paragraph of the essay presents several issues related to clarity, structure, and content. The overall message is somewhat muddled due to confusing syntax and word choice, which detracts from the intended emphasis on the author's memories of her homeland. The paragraph could benefit from more precise language and a clearer connection between the memories evoked by the spring season and the author's decision to retake her driving test. Additionally, the development of the argument lacks coherence, with details about animals and blossoming trees feeling tangential and underdeveloped. The organization is also weak, as transitions between sentences are abrupt, making the narrative hard to follow. Furthermore, grammatical errors such as \"memoreies,\" \"beautifu,\" and several awkward phrasings, impede readability and distract from the content. To improve, the essay should focus on refining sentence structures, ensuring grammatical accuracy, and creating a more logical flow of ideas to effectively convey the emotional significance of the author's memories.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it\u0092s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she\u0092ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus \u0093comes back to life\u0092\u0092. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good she\u0092ll feel good\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic attempt to engage with the prompt, but it lacks clarity and depth. The thesis is not clearly stated, making it difficult for readers to understand the main argument. The development of ideas is minimal and somewhat confusing. For example, instead of explaining why the author concluded the story with a statement about a new beginning, the essay drifts into discussing various unrelated aspects. Grammatical errors such as \"about,\" \"is,\" \"desrves,\" and inconsistent verb tenses detract significantly from the readability and flow of the essay. Additionally, the sentence structures are not varied, and the vocabulary is simple and often used incorrectly, leading to a monotonous tone. The paragraph lacks proper transitions, making it disjointed and hard to follow. There is also a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points made, which weakens the overall argument. For future improvement, the writer should focus on crafting a clear thesis, using varied and precise language, and providing specific examples to support their arguments, all while maintaining grammatical accuracy.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the story with  \u0093When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again\u0094 For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better. \u0093 A wave of loss so deep and\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a solid effort but struggles with clarity and structure. The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

        "llmResponse": "You have made an effort to address the prompt; however, your response lacks depth and clarity. The thesis statement is quite generic and does not clearly convey your main argument. To enhance your essay, you should focus on crafting a more precise thesis that explains why the author chose to end the story with this specific paragraph.\n\nYour analysis of Saeng's determination to pass her test is a good start, but it needs further development. Consider including specific examples from the story to support your points. For instance, you could discuss how the changing seasons and the blooming hibiscus symbolize hope and renewal for Saeng, which ties into her decision to retake the test in the spring.\n\nAdditionally, there are several grammatical issues that need attention. For instance, \"its\" should be \"it's\" to correctly use the contraction for \"it is.\" Also, \"determind\" should be \"determined.\" Ensure your sentences are complete and grammatically correct to enhance readability.\n\nTo improve your essay, focus on the following:\n1. **Thesis Statement**: Refine your thesis to clearly state why the author concludes with this paragraph.\n2. **Content Development**: Provide specific examples from the story to support your argument about Saeng's determination and the symbolism of the blooming hibiscus.\n3. **Grammar and Language**: Pay close attention to grammatical accuracy, spelling, and punctuation. Varied sentence structures and precise vocabulary will make your essay more engaging and readable.\n4. **Organization**: Structure your paragraphs logically with smooth transitions to create a cohesive flow of ideas.\n\nBy addressing these areas, you can create a more detailed and compelling essay that effectively responds to the prompt.",

Provide feedback that is aligned with the teacher's style and the class needs. Use all of the information at your disposable to customize to the teacher and class. Take the teacher instruction into account, in case they emphasize specifically what they want you to do.\n\n---------------------------\n\n----- TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is a persona of the teacher. Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.\n\n----- UPDATED TEACHER PERSONA -----\nAs a teacher who prioritizes grammatical accuracy and adherence to language conventions, my most high-priority goal is to ensure that each student's writing demonstrates a strong command of grammar and language conventions. This includes crafting clear and grammatically correct thesis statements, developing well-supported arguments with precise sentences, and concluding effectively. I aim for students to create essays with clear and logically structured paragraphs, utilizing varied and accurate vocabulary while maintaining grammatical precision, correct spelling, punctuation, and capitalization throughout their work.\n\nMy overall teaching style is centered around precision, clarity, and adherence to language conventions. I provide detailed and constructive feedback that focuses on grammatical accuracy and the development of clear, logically structured arguments. By highlighting specific areas for improvement, I help students understand their mistakes and make meaningful progress. When interacting with students, I emphasize the importance of clear communication and encourage them to ask questions whenever they encounter difficulties.\n\nMy feedback is thorough and aimed at helping students refine their writing skills, ensuring they grasp the nuances of grammar, syntax, and proper usage. I also make it a point to praise correct usage and well-structured arguments, reinforcing positive learning experiences. When reviewing student work, I assess the clarity of their thesis statements, the coherence and relevance of their supporting details, and the precision of their language. Essays that exhibit weak organization, fragmented sentences, or insufficient content development receive specific guidance on how to improve these areas.\n\nI focus not only on identifying errors but also on providing concrete suggestions for enhancement, such as refining vocabulary or restructuring paragraphs for better flow. For strong essays, I commend the logical flow, varied word choice, and adherence to writing conventions, noting how these elements contribute to the overall effectiveness of the piece.\n\nIn summary, my teaching approach is methodical and supportive, aiming to enhance students' mastery of the English language through consistent and precise feedback, clear instructions, and an open channel for questions and discussions. By maintaining high standards and providing constructive and specific feedback, I strive to help students become confident and skilled writers.\n\n\n\n----- FEEDBACK -----\nHere are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it\u0092s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she\u0092ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus \u0093comes back to life\u0092\u0092. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good she\u0092ll feel good\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic attempt to engage with the prompt, but it lacks clarity and depth. The thesis is not clearly stated, making it difficult for readers to understand the main argument. The development of ideas is minimal and somewhat confusing. For example, instead of explaining why the author concluded the story with a statement about a new beginning, the essay drifts into discussing various unrelated aspects. Grammatical errors such as \"about,\" \"is,\" \"desrves,\" and inconsistent verb tenses detract significantly from the readability and flow of the essay. Additionally, the sentence structures are not varied, and the vocabulary is simple and often used incorrectly, leading to a monotonous tone. The paragraph lacks proper transitions, making it disjointed and hard to follow. There is also a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points made, which weakens the overall argument. For future improvement, the writer should focus on crafting a clear thesis, using varied and precise language, and providing specific examples to support their arguments, all while maintaining grammatical accuracy.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the story with  \u0093When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again\u0094 For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better. \u0093 A wave of loss so deep and\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a solid effort but struggles with clarity and structure. The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succed, one must keep trying. Saeng will adapt to her new copiuntry in time but not if she spends heer time wishing to go back to her homeland. The hibiscus is a reminder to hers of starting a new and adapting to society. Saeng will retry her driver\u0092s test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided lacks clarity and is fraught with grammatical errors, which significantly impede its readability and effectiveness. The thesis statement is somewhat unclear, and the supporting sentences contain numerous mistakes, reducing the impact of the arguments presented. Consequently, the essay does not adequately address the prompt, nor does it remain focused on any coherent argument about Saeng's adaptation to her new country. The sentences are often incomplete or awkwardly structured, further detracting from the essay's overall readability. Additionally, the essay lacks a logical flow, with transitions that are neither smooth nor grammatically correct. The conclusion is abrupt and fails to effectively summarize the thesis, leaving the reader with an incomplete understanding of the author's main points. Improvements in grammatical accuracy, clearer thesis articulation, better organizational structure, and more precise language usage are needed to enhance the quality and coherence of this essay.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus \nby Minfong Ho \nSaeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng\nwalks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist\nshop to see if the plant can be purchased. \nIt was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat\nleaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in\nseemingly random profusion. \n\u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy\npotted plant by the corner. \nThere, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals\nsplayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of\nrecognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \n\u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. \nA saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with\nvermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into\nthe well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the\nbucket. \nSlowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,\noleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had\nnot even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. \nWhen she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and\ncool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. \nAnd beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with\npurplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to\nsee it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick\nwalls or between tiled roofs. \nAnd that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and\nfound a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.\n\u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said,\nsavoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its\ntag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d \nOne of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed\nher eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could\nalmost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she\ncombed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng\nwould help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. \nSaeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm\naround it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed\ncomb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? \nA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a\nchannel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. \nAnd in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. \nIt was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the\nlast remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.\nAs if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of\nthe onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to\nher. \nHer smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully.\n\u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed\nthe potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. \nMrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere\ndid you get it?\u201d \n\u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \n\u201cHow much?\u201d \nFor answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the \nLambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \n\u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \n\u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \n\u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this\nvegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed\nthe tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \n\u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. \nFor a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the\neye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. \nHer mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful\nplant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \n\u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the\nwords at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t\nas pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.\nThat\u2019s what matters.\u201d \nShe tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her\nother hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d \nShe went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The\nsoil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair\ntrailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There\nwas a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \n\u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. \nMrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and\nstart dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. \nLeft alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it.\nShe could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,\nthe sizzle of hot oil in the pan.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay demonstrates a commendable effort to engage with the text and explain why the author concluded the story with the specific paragraph in question. However, there are several areas that need improvement to enhance clarity, grammar, and overall effectiveness.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis statement, which suggests that the conclusion has a \"touching\" effect and sums up the points of the story, lacks precision and clarity. Consider revising it to more explicitly state your main argument. For example: \"The concluding paragraph of 'Winter Hibiscus' is impactful because it encapsulates Saeng's emotional journey and the themes of adaptation and resilience.\"\n\n2. **Grammar and Language**: There are multiple grammatical errors that detract from the readability of your essay. For example, \"author lend them many different ways\" should be \"authors end stories in many different ways.\" Additionally, \"touching affect\" should be \"touching effect,\" and \"paints talked about\" should be \"points discussed.\" Please proofread your work to correct these errors.\n\n3. **Supporting Evidence**: While you do provide quotes from the story, your analysis of these quotes is somewhat superficial and repetitive. For instance, you mention the touching effect twice without expanding on how the imagery of a \"silent lonely girl\" contributes to this effect. Provide more detailed explanations and connect them back to your thesis more clearly.\n\n4. **Organization and Structure**: Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Introduce each point with a topic sentence, provide evidence, analyze the evidence, and then link it back to your thesis. This will help create a logical flow and make your argument more coherent.\n\n5. **Vocabulary and Sentence Variety**: Your essay uses simple vocabulary and repetitive sentence structures. Try to incorporate more varied and precise language. For example, instead of \"touching effect,\" you might use \"emotional resonance\" or \"poignant impact.\"\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The conclusion of your essay is brief and does not effectively summarize your main points or restate your thesis. Strengthen your conclusion by summarizing how the final paragraph of the story ties together the themes and emotional journey of the protagonist.\n\nFor example:\n\"In conclusion, the final paragraph of 'Winter Hibiscus' effectively consolidates the themes of adaptation and resilience by evoking strong imagery and revisiting key elements of Saeng's experience. The author's use of vivid descriptions and symbolic references to the hibiscus and geese enhances the emotional impact, making the reader feel the depth of Saeng's silent vow to persevere and retake the test in the spring.\"\n\nBy focusing on these areas for improvement, you can create a more polished and compelling essay. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you need further clarification or assistance.",

The narrative effectively evokes a warm and comforting mood, supported by specific examples from the memoir. However, there are several grammatical errors and inconsistencies that detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. For instance, the use of \"@CAPS1\" appears to be a placeholder or redaction, which disrupts the flow of the text and makes it difficult to follow. Additionally, there are punctuation issues, such as the use of ampersands (&) instead of \"and,\" and some sentences are overly complex or improperly structured. The organization of the essay is mostly clear, with logical progression from one idea to the next, but some transitions could be smoother. The vocabulary is somewhat varied, though there are instances of repetition and incorrect usage. Overall, while the essay is interesting and provides a vivid portrayal of the author's family life, it would benefit greatly from a thorough review to correct grammatical errors and improve sentence structure.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created in this memoir is friendship. One reason is because his parents let the door open for the peope they considered family. A quote that shows this is \"My parents always kept their arms and their doors to the many people we consider family.

A quote that shows this is \"the demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" This\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay in question demonstrates a clear effort to convey the memoir's themes of friendship and family. However, it falls short in several key areas. The thesis statement is somewhat unclear and lacks grammatical accuracy. The arguments are presented, but they lack depth and sufficient development, making the supporting evidence seem superficial. Additionally, the sentences are grammatically correct but often simplistic and repetitive, leading to a lack of complexity and variation in word choice and sentence structure. The organization of the essay is weak, with transitions and topic sentences that do not effectively guide the reader through the argument. Furthermore, there are noticeable errors in spelling and punctuation, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. To improve, the writer should focus on crafting a clear and grammatically correct thesis statement, developing arguments with greater depth and precision, and ensuring that transitions and topic sentences are logically structured and grammatically accurate. Enhanced vocabulary and varied sentence structures would also contribute to a more engaging and effective essay.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the story with  \u0093When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again\u0094 For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture.

The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

After living for a year in a \nfurnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old \nNarciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon \ncall home. \nIn 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the \nIronbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our \ntraditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared \ncooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking \nthat is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which \nI adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of \nchildhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed \nboth, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. \nGrowing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \u201cfamily\u201d had nothing to do with \nbeing a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, \nCuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation \nprevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these \ncultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of \nhonest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their \nown kind, were clearly in need. \nOur landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and \nAlegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio \nand Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not \nknow my \u201creal\u201d grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were \nallowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and \nRosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family \nmembers came and went \u2014 and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they \nwere able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the \nmany people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. \nMy mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the \nlanguage or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a \nbetter life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country \nthey loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters \nwhile yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were \nstrong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind \nof jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had \nstudied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, \ntaking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their \nchildren to better times drove them to endure these hard times. \nI will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I\u2019ve often told them that what \nthey did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I\u2019ve often told them of \nmy admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I\u2019ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in \nreality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at \nsuch an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two \nlessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these \nteachings have been the basis of my life. \nIt was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to \nthis country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this \nhumble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not \njust scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of \u201cfamily.\u201d \nAnd for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I \nlearned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into \na home. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-5-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 5 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nDescribe the mood created by the author in the memoir.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay offers a thoughtful reflection on the memoir \"Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives.\" You successfully highlight the main themes of family, culture, and the creation of a warm home environment despite challenges. However, there are several areas that need improvement to enhance clarity, structure, and grammatical accuracy.\n\nFirstly, your thesis statement is somewhat vague and could be more specific. A clearer thesis would help anchor your essay and guide your arguments more effectively. For instance, you might specify the exact mood created by the memoir and how the author achieves this.\n\nYour essay contains several instances of informal language and phrases that could be more precise. For example, \"from what I've known, heard and seen\" could be rephrased to \"based on my observations and knowledge.\" Additionally, the phrase \"a side of racism and discrimination occasionally\" is somewhat awkward; consider rephrasing for clarity and grammatical correctness.\n\nThere are also some grammatical errors and issues with sentence structure. For instance, \"Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally\" is a run-on sentence and could be split for better clarity. Furthermore, the phrase \"This quote kind of lightens up the whole idea of this memoir\" is colloquial and imprecise. Instead, you could write, \"This quote encapsulates the memoir's central theme of finding joy and community amidst adversity.\"\n\nYour use of evidence from the memoir is commendable, but it would benefit from more detailed analysis. After presenting the quote, delve deeper into how it supports the mood you identified. Explain how the specific elements of family gatherings, cultural traditions, and celebrations contribute to the overall atmosphere of warmth and resilience.\n\nThe organization of your essay could also be improved. Ensure each paragraph transitions smoothly to the next and that your ideas are logically ordered. For example, start with a strong introduction that includes your refined thesis, followed by body paragraphs that each address a specific point supported by evidence from the text.\n\nLastly, pay attention to spelling, punctuation, and capitalization throughout your essay. Consistent errors in these areas can detract from the overall quality and readability of your writing.\n\nIn summary, while your essay effectively touches on the memoir's key themes, refining your thesis, enhancing grammatical accuracy, improving sentence structure, and providing deeper analysis will significantly strengthen your work. Keep practicing these elements, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you encounter difficulties. Your engagement with the text is evident, and with these improvements, you will be able to convey your insights more clearly and effectively.",

This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved.\" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again.

The reading made me happy for Narciso, but curious on how much his parents had to struggle to give Narciso the best life he could get. For example the author states that his parents had to \"start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find.\" Back in Cuba, \"Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso mom) had Studied chemical engineering.\" This shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to @LOCATION1. This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved.\" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again. The author creates a variety of different moods throught the memoir.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Your essay displays a commendable effort to engage with the text and explore the moods created by the author. You've effectively identified multiple emotions, such as happiness, curiosity, and sadness, and supported your points with relevant quotes from the memoir. However, there are several areas that need refinement to enhance the clarity and coherence of your essay.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis statement is apparent, but it could benefit from greater precision and grammatical accuracy. Consider refining it to clearly state the main moods you intend to discuss. For example: \"The author creates a happy yet curious mood, while also evoking sadness, to illustrate the complex emotions surrounding his family's immigration story.\"\n\n2. **Supporting Arguments**: While you have included quotes from the memoir, your analysis of these quotes could be more detailed. Rather than simply stating that the quotes made you feel a certain way, delve deeper into how the author's word choices and descriptions contribute to these moods.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Grammar**: There are several grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures that impede the flow of your essay. For instance, \"Narciso mom\" should be \"Narciso's mom,\" and \"This made me wonder why they would do this\" could be clarified. Additionally, the use of placeholders like \"@LOCATION1\" and \"@MONTH1\" disrupts the reading experience. Ensure all placeholders are replaced with the appropriate information.\n\n4. **Vocabulary and Word Choice**: Aim for more varied and precise vocabulary. Words like \"happy\" and \"sad\" are somewhat simplistic; using more descriptive terms can add depth to your analysis. For example, instead of \"happy,\" you might say \"uplifted\" or \"joyful,\" and instead of \"sad,\" you might say \"melancholic\" or \"heart-wrenching.\"\n\n5. **Organization and Transitions**: Your essay would benefit from smoother transitions between ideas. Each paragraph should clearly link back to your thesis and build on the previous point. For example, you could use transitional phrases like \"Furthermore,\" \"Additionally,\" or \"Conversely\" to guide the reader through your argument.\n\n6. **Spelling and Punctuation**: Pay close attention to spelling and punctuation. Words like \"carrers\" should be corrected to \"careers,\" and ensure proper capitalization throughout your essay (e.g., \"Studied\" should be \"studied\").\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion should effectively summarize the main points of your essay and restate the thesis in a new light. Ensure it ties all the moods you've discussed back to the overall impact of the memoir.\n\n**Revised Example**:\n\nThe author creates a varied emotional landscape in the memoir, evoking happiness, curiosity, and sadness to illustrate the complexities of his family's immigration experience. The happiness stems from Narciso's optimistic upbringing, while curiosity arises from the sacrifices his parents made for his future. For instance, the author notes that his parents \"start their lives over entirely,",

For example, when I am always using the computer and when I'm doing research it always gives me the ability to learn about new places and people. Another example is when ever I watch @CAPS2.V on @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says that people learn about learn about faraway places and people on the internet @PERCENT1 of the time. @CAPS1 second reason is it allows people to talk online with other people for example when I am on the computer everyday I visit @CAPS1 facebook it always gives me a chance to talk to @CAPS1 friends and other people online. Another example is when I go on a computer and I search computers.org it says that it lets people @PERCENT2 of the time talk to others online. @CAPS1 @NUM4 reason is it allows students to get information when they're doing a project. For example when I always use the @ORGANIZATION1 computers it allows me to get information for example, about @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 govina that is why I benefit people using computers. Another example is when ever I check out a magazine on computers it tells me that kids get alot of information when they're doing projects @PERCENT2 of the time.

I say this because lots of people can talk to family of friends long distance. Also the computer can teach you lots of thing. Finally it makes you more social. In @CAPS1 strong opinion computers are better for the world. Firstly, many people can talk long distance with family of friends. You have web cam and that allows you to chat and see the person. Also @CAPS2 is another site\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and relevant thesis statement regarding the benefits of computers, and the main ideas are adequately supported with examples. However, the arguments could benefit from more specific real-world examples and pragmatic reasoning to strengthen the claims. The essay is organized with an introduction, body, and conclusion, but the transitions between paragraphs and the overall flow could be improved for a smoother reading experience. The word choice is mostly effective, conveying the intended message clearly, although some phrases lack precision and could be refined for better clarity. The sentence structures are varied but could be more fluid to enhance readability. There are minimal errors in conventions, but attention to correct usage of punctuation, spelling, and capitalization would improve the overall quality. Overall, the essay is clear and focused, but it could be enhanced with better organization, more precise language, and stronger examples to fully meet the teacher's expectations for clarity, practicality, and linguistic precision.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear Newspaper editor I would like to make @CAPS3 about the benifits of owning a computer. For example you can learn many thing you would of never of been able too, you can also go in chat rooms and talk with friends or other people and it can even make teaching esyer too. Computers in many countres are standard and we use then to learn many things but if you bring one to the tribes in @LOCATION1 it will look like a alein object but once they know how to use it it can open there eyes for ever\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay you presented demonstrates a genuine enthusiasm for the topic of the benefits of owning a computer, but it requires significant refinement in several areas to meet higher standards. The content is somewhat clear and addresses the prompt, though the examples provided are often broad and lack depth in real-world relevance. Incorporating more specific, illustrative examples would enhance the argument's effectiveness. The organization of the essay is somewhat disjointed, with ideas jumping from one to another without clear transitions or a logical flow. Improving the structure by using well-defined topic sentences and coherent transitions between paragraphs would help. \n\nIn terms of word choice, the essay frequently uses casual and imprecise language, which detracts from its persuasive power. Employing a more formal and precise vocabulary would improve readability and impact. Sentence fluency is also an issue; many sentences are awkwardly constructed and run-on, making the essay difficult to follow at times. Simplifying sentence structures and varying them would help create a smoother reading experience. Finally, conventions are a major area for improvement. The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, incorrect spelling, and improper punctuation, all of which impede readability and distract from the argument. A thorough proofreading to correct these mistakes is essential. Overall, while the essay shows promise in engaging with the topic, it needs significant work in clarity, structure, language precision, and grammatical accuracy to fully persuade the reader.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear local newspaper, I am writing this letter to you to show on how people get effected from computers. It effects people very well and teaches people many things for just one technology. Computers effects many people for what it does. Computers have many advantages that people learn very quickly. Many people love computers. It is one of the most best inventions to everyone around the world. They teach positive things for people to learn. Computer even have a positive effect on people across\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear stance on the positive effects of computers but lacks depth and specificity in its arguments. The thesis is somewhat ambiguous and repetitive, which diminishes its overall clarity and impact. There is an attempt to develop and support the thesis, but the examples provided are general and unconvincing. For instance, the discussion on hand-eye coordination is not thoroughly explained or supported with concrete evidence. The organization of the essay is basic, with a discernible introduction, body, and conclusion; however, the flow of ideas is somewhat disjointed and lacks smooth transitions. The language used is simplistic and at times redundant, which affects the precision and engagement of the writing. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors and awkward sentence constructions that impede readability. To strengthen the essay, it would benefit from a more precise thesis, richer and more specific examples, improved coherence, and careful attention to language and stylistic choices. Overall, the essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the topic but requires significant refinement to meet the teacher's expectations for clarity, practicality, and precision.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-1-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 1 \nPrompt \nMore and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society.

I am @NUM1 years old and I go to a @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION1 called @ORGANIZATION1. I am a really smart kid. In @CAPS1 opinion I benefit people using computers. You should keep reading @CAPS1 essay because I am going to tell you @NUM2 good reasons why I benefit people using computers. @CAPS1 first reason is they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. For example, when I am always using the computer and when I'm doing research it always gives me the ability to learn about new places and people. Another example is when ever I watch @CAPS2.V on @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says that people learn about learn about faraway places and people on the internet @PERCENT1 of the time. @CAPS1 second reason is it allows people to talk online with other people for example when I am on the computer everyday I visit @CAPS1 facebook it always gives me a chance to talk to @CAPS1 friends and other people online. Another example is when I go on a computer and I search computers.org it says that it lets people @PERCENT2 of the time talk to others online. @CAPS1 @NUM4 reason is it allows students to get information when they're doing a project. For example when I always use the @ORGANIZATION1 computers it allows me to get information for example, about @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 govina that is why I benefit people using computers. Another example is when ever I check out a magazine on computers it tells me that kids get alot of information when they're doing projects @PERCENT2 of the time. In conclusion, I benefit people using computers because they teach hand eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, it allows people to talk online with other people and it allows students to get information when they're doing projects. Those are the @NUM2 reasons why I benefit people using computers. So please the local newspaper please try to make this believable.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Dear [Student's Name],\n\nThank you for your effort in writing this letter to the local newspaper. I can see that you have put thought into the reasons why computers are beneficial, which is a great start. Below, I have provided detailed feedback to help you improve your essay and align it more closely with the expectations of clear, practical, and effective writing.\n\n1. **Ideas & Content**: \n   - Your essay presents a clear opinion about the benefits of computers, which is good. However, the examples you provided are somewhat generic and lack depth. For instance, when you mention using the computer to learn about new places, it would be more convincing to include specific examples of places you've learned about and how this knowledge has benefited you.\n   - Similarly, the statistics you cited (e.g., \u201c@PERCENT1 of the time\u201d) are vague. Including real-world examples or more precise data would strengthen your argument significantly. For example, refer to a study or a credible source that supports your claims about the benefits of computers.\n\n2. **Organization**:\n   - Your essay has a basic structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, which is good. However, the flow of ideas can be improved. Make sure each paragraph has a clear topic sentence and that your arguments are logically organized.\n   - Transitions between points could be smoother. For instance, use connecting phrases like \u201cFurthermore,\u201d \u201cIn addition,\u201d or \u201cMoreover\u201d to guide the reader through your arguments more effectively.\n\n3. **Word Choice**:\n   - Your word choice is generally clear, but at times it is too informal. For example, phrases like \u201canother example is\u201d can be replaced with more varied and precise language. \n   - Avoid repetitive phrases and try to use a broader range of vocabulary to make your writing more engaging. Instead of repeatedly saying \u201cfor example,\u201d you could use expressions like \u201can instance of this is,\u201d \u201csuch as,\u201d or \u201cto illustrate this point.\u201d\n\n4. **Sentence Fluency**:\n   - Some of your sentences are awkwardly constructed and repetitive. For instance, \u201cwhen I'm doing research it always gives me the ability to learn about new places and people\u201d could be simplified to \u201cresearching on the computer allows me to learn about new places and people.\u201d \n   - Varying sentence length and structure will help improve readability and keep the reader\u2019s interest. Try combining shorter sentences into more complex ones where appropriate.\n\n5. **Conventions**:\n   - There are several grammatical errors and issues with punctuation, capitalization, and spelling that need to be addressed. For example, \u201calot\u201d should be \u201ca lot,\u201d and \u201cwhenever\u201d should be \u201cwhen ever\u201d in the context you used.\n   - Proofreading your work or using a spelling and grammar check tool can help identify and correct these errors. Proper use of conventions enhances clarity and professionalism.\n\n**Practical Suggestions**:\n- **Revise your thesis statement**: Make",

        "textSelection": "Does censorship solve any problems?  If one person wants to censor something in a library, there is bound to be another person on the other side of that arguement  trying to protect that work from be taken away.  As a free country, it is every individuals right to take in whatever form of literature or music that they find pleasing, and history has shown the world that censorship leads those in power down a dark road.  The shielding of offensive materials is only necessary and fair when the young, impressionable minds of the world's youth are at stake, but once a person is old enough to make informed decisions, it should be their perrogative to choose their own material.  Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history, but necessary when protecting the young.     It is a person's right to choose what kind of literature they would like to read.  If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned.  For example take a hypothetical public library: a public library is an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music.  A great mental image of serenity and peace.  How does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves?  Suddenly right and left, books are disappearing as if by magic: a ceratin book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad.  Before long, there are not very many books left in this hypothetical library other than books for toddlers.  With this system, everyone suffers.  Everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to.  It would all just be simpler if book were just not banned from libraries.     History has given the world many a cruel dictator.  Oftentimes, once he comes to power, he is not the most popular of governmental forms.  To keep his subjects underneath his rule, often he has to resort to taking away civil rights.  This could be a curfew, fake elections, or censorship.  If the ruler has the power of censorship, he or she can control what the public thinks, feels, and believes.  With this power over them, the people are weakened and often abused.  Now imagine that censorship occuring in a country that has civil rights.  People would not stand for it.  So why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom?  There is absolutely no need for censorship to occur, and as history has shown, it certainly is not a good thing.     Censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights.  There is, however, one other element at play here: protection of youth and innocence.  Almost everyone can remember a time a child when they were young and innocent, free of worry and trouble.  That can disappear in a instant.  Children should not be exposed to things that are innappropriate for their age.  Nearly every movie nowadays has violent and risque, if not full-blown-adult, materials present in it.  The age of innocence is getting younger every generation, and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point.  A claim like this @MONTH1 sound hypotcritical coming from the mouth of one against censorship, but it is not 'censorship' when one is protecting the young.      Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children.  It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon.  The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people.  Also, children should be protected, and that is not censorship.  Censorship solves no problems, but it makes everyone unhappy.  Therefore, why censor",

Books should not be tooken off the shelf just because some people find them offensive. Do not get the book, other people might like it, its just for entertainment.     If you do not like the book do not have to get the book. While looking for a book if there is one that does not seem right just look past. It will not even be a bother. There is a lot of books in the library, just find a different book instead of just focusing on that\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to address the topic of censorship in libraries; however, it lacks clarity and depth in its arguments. The main ideas are overly broad and repetitive, failing to engage the reader or provide strong support for the thesis. The essay's organization is weak, with a loose structure that lacks clear transitions and well-defined topic sentences, making it challenging to follow the author's train of thought. The word choice is often inappropriate and imprecise, using informal and incorrect terms such as \"tooken.\" The sentence fluency is mechanical, with awkward constructions that impede readability. Furthermore, the essay contains several grammatical errors, including incorrect verb tense and punctuation issues, which detract from its overall effectiveness. To improve, the author should focus on developing a clear, concise thesis and supporting it with relevant, well-organized arguments and real-world examples. Additionally, attention should be given to refining sentence structure and word choice, as well as proofreading for grammatical accuracy.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

If one person wants to censor something in a library, there is bound to be another person on the other side of that arguement  trying to protect that work from be taken away.  As a free country, it is every individuals right to take in whatever form of literature or music that they find pleasing, and history has shown the world that censorship leads those in power down a dark road.  The shielding of offensive materials is only necessary and fair when the young, impressionable minds of the world's youth are at stake, but once a person is old enough to make informed decisions, it should be their perrogative to choose their own material.  Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history, but necessary when protecting the young.     It is a person's right to choose what kind of literature they would like to read.  If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned.  For example take a hypothetical public library: a public library is an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music.  A great mental image of serenity and peace.  How does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves?  Suddenly right and left, books are disappearing as if by magic: a ceratin book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad.  Before long, there are not very many books left in this hypothetical library other than books for toddlers.  With this system, everyone suffers.  Everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to.  It would all just be simpler if book were just not banned from libraries.     History has given the world many a cruel dictator.  Oftentimes, once he comes to power, he is not the most popular of governmental forms.  To keep his subjects underneath his rule, often he has to resort to taking away civil rights.  This could be a curfew, fake elections, or censorship.  If the ruler has the power of censorship, he or she can control what the public thinks, feels, and believes.  With this power over them, the people are weakened and often abused.  Now imagine that censorship occuring in a country that has civil rights.  People would not stand for it.  So why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom?  There is absolutely no need for censorship to occur, and as history has shown, it certainly is not a good thing.     Censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights.  There is, however, one other element at play here: protection of youth and innocence.  Almost everyone can remember a time a child when they were young and innocent, free of worry and trouble.  That can disappear in a instant.  Children should not be exposed to things that are innappropriate for their age.  Nearly every movie nowadays has violent and risque, if not full-blown-adult, materials present in it.  The age of innocence is getting younger every generation, and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point.  A claim like this @MONTH1 sound hypotcritical coming from the mouth of one against censorship, but it is not 'censorship' when one is protecting the young.      Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children.  It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon.  The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people.  Also, children should be protected, and that is not censorship.  Censorship solves no problems, but it makes everyone unhappy.  Therefore, why censor\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Your essay on censorship in libraries demonstrates a commendable effort to tackle a complex and nuanced issue. Your main ideas are clear, and your passion for the topic is evident. However, there are several areas where improvements can be made to strengthen your argument and enhance the overall quality of your writing.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement and Introduction**:\n   - **Feedback**: Your thesis statement is somewhat buried within the introductory paragraph. It would be more effective if you explicitly state your stance on censorship early on. For example, \"Censorship in libraries should be opposed on the grounds of personal rights and historical consequences, except when it comes to protecting young and impressionable minds.\"\n   - **Suggestion**: Consider revising your introduction to clearly present your thesis statement, setting the stage for the arguments you will develop.\n\n2. **Organization and Structure**:\n   - **Feedback**: While your essay contains relevant points, the organization could be improved for better coherence. The transitions between paragraphs are sometimes abrupt, and the connection between ideas can be strengthened.\n   - **Suggestion**: Use clear topic sentences at the beginning of each paragraph to guide the reader through your arguments. For example, \"One of the primary reasons censorship should be opposed is because it infringes on personal rights.\"\n\n3. **Supporting Arguments with Real-World Examples**:\n   - **Feedback**: Your essay would benefit from more concrete real-world examples to support your points. While the hypothetical library scenario is effective, incorporating historical or contemporary examples would add depth to your argument.\n   - **Suggestion**: Mention specific historical instances where censorship led to negative outcomes, such as book burnings in Nazi Germany or censorship in authoritarian regimes.\n\n4. **Word Choice and Sentence Fluency**:\n   - **Feedback**: Some of your word choices and phrases could be more precise. Also, ensure that your sentences flow smoothly to maintain the reader's interest.\n   - **Suggestion**: Instead of \"if one person wants to censor something in a library,\" you could say, \"when individuals seek to censor materials in a library.\" Additionally, revise sentences for clarity and conciseness. For example, \"History has shown that censorship often leads those in power down a dark road\" can be simplified to \"History demonstrates that censorship often results in the abuse of power.\"\n\n5. **Grammar, Spelling, and Punctuation**:\n   - **Feedback**: There are several grammatical errors and misspellings that need to be addressed. For instance, \"perrogative\" should be \"prerogative,\" and \"ceratin\" should be \"certain.\"\n   - **Suggestion**: Carefully proofread your essay or use a spell-check tool to catch these errors. Additionally, consider reading your essay aloud to catch awkward phrasing or punctuation mistakes.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - **Feedback**: Your conclusion reiterates your main points but could be more compelling.\n   - **Suggestion**: Strengthen your conclusion by",

First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic response to the prompt by discussing how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, focusing on rolling hills, open terrain, and high deserts. However, it lacks depth and specificity in its supporting details, which limits the clarity and persuasiveness of the arguments. The writer uses some real-world examples but does not fully develop them to support their points effectively. The narrative follows a logical sequence, but transitions between ideas are somewhat abrupt, making the flow less smooth. While the language is generally clear and functional, it shows occasional errors in spelling and grammar, such as \"terran,\" \"hgh,\" and \"mles,\" which detract from the overall readability. Improving the essay would involve elaborating on the points with more detailed and specific examples, enhancing the transitions between ideas for better coherence, and carefully proofreading to correct grammatical errors.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay lacks clarity and practical relevance, making it difficult for the reader to follow the main points. The thesis is neither clear nor well-developed, leaving the intent and purpose of the essay ambiguous. The arguments are simplistic and not supported by real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning, which diminishes their impact. The conclusion is ineffective and fails to reinforce the thesis with practical implications. The organizational structure is weak, with ideas that are not coherently presented or logically connected through clear transitions and defined topic sentences. In terms of language and style, the essay employs a limited vocabulary, with word choices that are often inappropriate for the context, and sentence structures that are awkward and disjointed. The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which further impedes readability and detracts from the essay's overall quality. To improve, the essay needs a clear thesis, well-supported arguments with real-world examples, a logical structure with coherent transitions, appropriate and varied vocabulary, and meticulous attention to grammatical conventions.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The arhuror concludes this story with this paragraph to show people that the story or people in the story have a thing for nature or like writing about nature like whats in nature the change or maybe this story is about nature at its best.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is quite disorganized and lacks clarity and practical focus. The thesis is unclear, and the content is not developed with concrete, real-world evidence or pragmatic reasoning. The argument about the story and nature is repetitive and vague, leaving the reader without a clear understanding of the author's point. Additionally, the conclusion does not effectively reinforce the thesis or provide practical implications. Structurally, the essay falls short of the expected standards. It lacks a coherent organization, with no clear introduction, body, or conclusion. Transitions between ideas are absent, making the essay difficult to follow. The language and style used are inappropriate for the audience and purpose; there are numerous grammatical errors, misspellings, and issues with punctuation and capitalization. Words are often misused, which further obscures the intended meaning. Overall, the essay needs significant revision to improve clarity, practicality, structure, and adherence to standard writing conventions.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

No, a better piece \nof advice for the solo cyclist would be, \u201cNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers \nwho haven\u2019t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.\u201d It\u2019s not that a group of \nold guys doesn\u2019t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid \nplace. Things change. \nAt a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer \nevening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn\u2019t have done was \nlet them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice \nand launched out at first light along a \u201cshortcut\u201d that was to slice away hours from my ride to \nYosemite National Park. \nThey\u2019d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I \nwould come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with \nstrong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first \u201ctown.\u201d \nThis place might have been a thriving little spot at one time\u2014say, before the last world war\u2014but \non that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water \nsupply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool \npines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. \nTwenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, \nand a corral that couldn\u2019t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had \nbeen hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of \nCalifornia in June. \nI got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my \nstrength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the \nneighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water \nwouldn\u2019t cool down. It didn\u2019t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. \nThe old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make \nthat! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so\u2014a test of my inner spirit. \nNot two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was \nreplaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign \njumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. \nThe speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so \ncruel. \nI toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake\u2014it \nreally did look like a diamondback\u2014blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased \npast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. \nThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my \nshirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June \nsimply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn\u2019t been off their porch in decades, \ncaused me to laugh. \nIt was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. \nThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride \ndown into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I\u2019d \nbe fine. \nOver one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make \nsure it wasn\u2019t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst \nof energy, I maneuvered down the hill. \nIn an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building\u2014abandoned years \nearlier, by the looks of it\u2014had been a Welch\u2019s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A \nsandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still \nbe seen. \nI hung my head. \nThat smoky blues tune \u201cSummertime\u201d rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating \nbrain. \nI got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. \nI\u2019d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you \nhave left to circulate. With any luck I\u2019d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. \nIt didn\u2019t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some \nexpensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and \ntheir keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I \nwas going to lose consciousness for the last time. \nSomehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining \nelevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear \nwere all behind me. \nGARY AND WILBER\u2019S FISH CAMP\u2014IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE\u2019RE \nYOUR BEST BET! \n\u201cAnd the only bet,\u201d I remember thinking. \nAs I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an \noverwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait\u2014any bait, even \nthough I didn\u2019t own a rod or reel. \nAn old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction.

In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes he\u0092s experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town. ''at first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little scketle at it because the old \u0093codgers\u0094  told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel.\u0094 Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men.        \nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Your essay attempts to address how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, which is a good start. However, there are several areas that need significant improvement to meet the expectations of clear, practical, and effective writing.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis is somewhat vague. Make sure to clearly state how the setting affects the cyclist in a concise manner at the beginning of your essay. For example, \"The harsh desert setting significantly impacts the cyclist by depleting his resources and challenging his endurance.\"\n\n2. **Supporting Evidence**: You have included some quotes from the text, which is good. However, they are not fully integrated into your argument. Be sure to explain how each example directly supports your point. For instance, when mentioning the ghost town, elaborate on how this contributes to the cyclist's sense of isolation and desperation.\n\n3. **Organization and Coherence**: Your essay needs a more logical structure. Start with an introductory paragraph that includes a clear thesis statement. Follow with body paragraphs that each focus on a specific aspect of the setting and how it affects the cyclist. Use clear topic sentences to introduce each paragraph and ensure smooth transitions between ideas.\n\n4. **Grammar, Spelling, and Punctuation**: There are numerous grammatical and spelling errors that detract from the readability of your essay. Errors such as \"Certin,\" \"desribes,\" \"he\u2019s,\" \"difinition,\" \"scketle,\" \"untill,\" \"soluation,\" and \"sorching son\" need to be corrected. Always proofread your work or use tools to help identify and correct these mistakes.\n\n5. **Vocabulary and Style**: Your language needs to be more precise and varied. Avoid repetitive phrasing and aim to use more sophisticated vocabulary where appropriate. For example, instead of \"maybe a little scketle at it,\" you could say \"somewhat skeptical.\"\n\n6. **Real-World Relevance**: While the essay is based on a fictional narrative, try to draw connections to real-world scenarios, emphasizing the practical implications of the cyclist's experience. This will strengthen your arguments and make your essay more impactful.\n\n### Practical Suggestions for Improvement:\n- **Revise your thesis** to make it clearer and more direct.\n- **Integrate quotes more effectively** by explaining their relevance to your argument.\n- **Structure your essay** with a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion.\n- **Proofread carefully** to fix grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors.\n- **Enhance your vocabulary** to make your writing more engaging and precise.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, you can improve the clarity, coherence, and overall quality of your essay. Remember, writing is a process of continuous refinement and revision, so take the time to carefully revise your work. Keep striving for clear and effective communication in your writing.",

First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic response to the prompt by discussing how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, focusing on rolling hills, open terrain, and high deserts. However, it lacks depth and specificity in its supporting details, which limits the clarity and persuasiveness of the arguments. The writer uses some real-world examples but does not fully develop them to support their points effectively. The narrative follows a logical sequence, but transitions between ideas are somewhat abrupt, making the flow less smooth. While the language is generally clear and functional, it shows occasional errors in spelling and grammar, such as \"terran,\" \"hgh,\" and \"mles,\" which detract from the overall readability. Improving the essay would involve elaborating on the points with more detailed and specific examples, enhancing the transitions between ideas for better coherence, and carefully proofreading to correct grammatical errors.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay lacks clarity and practical relevance, making it difficult for the reader to follow the main points. The thesis is neither clear nor well-developed, leaving the intent and purpose of the essay ambiguous. The arguments are simplistic and not supported by real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning, which diminishes their impact. The conclusion is ineffective and fails to reinforce the thesis with practical implications. The organizational structure is weak, with ideas that are not coherently presented or logically connected through clear transitions and defined topic sentences. In terms of language and style, the essay employs a limited vocabulary, with word choices that are often inappropriate for the context, and sentence structures that are awkward and disjointed. The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which further impedes readability and detracts from the essay's overall quality. To improve, the essay needs a clear thesis, well-supported arguments with real-world examples, a logical structure with coherent transitions, appropriate and varied vocabulary, and meticulous attention to grammatical conventions.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The arhuror concludes this story with this paragraph to show people that the story or people in the story have a thing for nature or like writing about nature like whats in nature the change or maybe this story is about nature at its best.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is quite disorganized and lacks clarity and practical focus. The thesis is unclear, and the content is not developed with concrete, real-world evidence or pragmatic reasoning. The argument about the story and nature is repetitive and vague, leaving the reader without a clear understanding of the author's point. Additionally, the conclusion does not effectively reinforce the thesis or provide practical implications. Structurally, the essay falls short of the expected standards. It lacks a coherent organization, with no clear introduction, body, or conclusion. Transitions between ideas are absent, making the essay difficult to follow. The language and style used are inappropriate for the audience and purpose; there are numerous grammatical errors, misspellings, and issues with punctuation and capitalization. Words are often misused, which further obscures the intended meaning. Overall, the essay needs significant revision to improve clarity, practicality, structure, and adherence to standard writing conventions.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

No, a better piece \nof advice for the solo cyclist would be, \u201cNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers \nwho haven\u2019t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.\u201d It\u2019s not that a group of \nold guys doesn\u2019t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid \nplace. Things change. \nAt a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer \nevening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn\u2019t have done was \nlet them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice \nand launched out at first light along a \u201cshortcut\u201d that was to slice away hours from my ride to \nYosemite National Park. \nThey\u2019d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I \nwould come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with \nstrong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first \u201ctown.\u201d \nThis place might have been a thriving little spot at one time\u2014say, before the last world war\u2014but \non that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water \nsupply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool \npines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. \nTwenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, \nand a corral that couldn\u2019t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had \nbeen hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of \nCalifornia in June. \nI got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my \nstrength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the \nneighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water \nwouldn\u2019t cool down. It didn\u2019t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. \nThe old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make \nthat! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so\u2014a test of my inner spirit. \nNot two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was \nreplaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign \njumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. \nThe speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so \ncruel. \nI toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake\u2014it \nreally did look like a diamondback\u2014blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased \npast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. \nThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my \nshirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June \nsimply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn\u2019t been off their porch in decades, \ncaused me to laugh. \nIt was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. \nThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride \ndown into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I\u2019d \nbe fine. \nOver one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make \nsure it wasn\u2019t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst \nof energy, I maneuvered down the hill. \nIn an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building\u2014abandoned years \nearlier, by the looks of it\u2014had been a Welch\u2019s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A \nsandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still \nbe seen. \nI hung my head. \nThat smoky blues tune \u201cSummertime\u201d rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating \nbrain. \nI got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. \nI\u2019d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you \nhave left to circulate. With any luck I\u2019d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. \nIt didn\u2019t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some \nexpensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and \ntheir keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I \nwas going to lose consciousness for the last time. \nSomehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining \nelevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear \nwere all behind me. \nGARY AND WILBER\u2019S FISH CAMP\u2014IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE\u2019RE \nYOUR BEST BET! \n\u201cAnd the only bet,\u201d I remember thinking. \nAs I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an \noverwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait\u2014any bait, even \nthough I didn\u2019t own a rod or reel. \nAn old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from \nmy head as I slumped against the wall beside him. \n\u201cWhere you headed in such a hurry?\u201d \n\u201cYosemite,\u201d I whispered. \n\u201cKnow the best way to get there?\u201d \nI watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group \nI\u2019d listened to in Lodi. \n\u201cYes, sir!

        "llmResponse": "**Feedback:**\n\nYour essay touches on several key features of the setting that affect the cyclist, including the sun, ghost towns, obstacles, and terrain. You have identified these elements and attempted to explain their impacts on the cyclist, which is a good start. However, there are several areas where your essay could be improved for clarity, organization, and coherence.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement and Organization:**\n   - Your essay needs a clear and concise thesis statement at the beginning to outline your main points and guide the reader through your arguments. For example, \"The cyclist\u2019s journey is significantly impacted by the harsh sun, desolate ghost towns, various obstacles, and challenging terrain.\"\n   - Ensure each paragraph focuses on one main idea and includes a topic sentence to introduce that idea. This will help your essay flow more logically and make it easier to follow.\n\n2. **Supporting Details and Real-World Examples:**\n   - You have selected relevant details from the source text, but your explanations need to be more developed and specific. For example, when discussing the sun, you mention the cyclist becoming hot and thirsty, but you could elaborate on how this affects his physical condition and mental state.\n   - When discussing the ghost towns, you should explain how the lack of water and supplies exacerbates the cyclist's sense of hopelessness and physical fatigue.\n\n3. **Grammar, Spelling, and Punctuation:**\n   - There are several grammatical errors and unclear phrases in your essay. For instance, \"thirsty-ness redufrom\" should be corrected to \"thirstiness reduced.\" Additionally, \"ram-shackle sheds\" should be \"ramshackle sheds,\" and \"didn't have any watch for them to feel up with as he became dehydrated\" is unclear and should be revised.\n   - Make sure to proofread your work to correct spelling errors, such as \"effect\" instead of \"affect\" and \"summer the hell\" instead of \"summit the hill.\"\n\n4. **Clarity and Practical Language:**\n   - Use practical and straightforward language to express your ideas clearly. For example, \"The sun caused the cyclist to become extremely hot and thirsty, reducing his limited water supply and making the journey more challenging.\"\n   - Avoid repetitive phrases and ensure your sentences are clear and concise.\n\n5. **Transitions and Coherence:**\n   - Use transitional words and phrases to connect your ideas and create a smooth flow between paragraphs. Phrases like \"Moreover,\" \"Additionally,\" and \"Finally\" can help guide your reader through your arguments.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Your essay lacks a concluding paragraph that reinforces your thesis and summarizes the main points. Be sure to include a brief conclusion that ties everything together and reiterates how the setting's features affected the cyclist.\n\n**Revised Example:**\n\"The cyclist's journey is significantly impacted by the harsh sun, desolate ghost towns, various obstacles, and challenging terrain.

I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is extremely difficult to understand due to its lack of clarity and coherence. The thesis is unclear and not relevant to any prompt, making it challenging for the reader to grasp the main idea or argument. The essay does not develop or support its arguments with real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning. Moreover, the structure of the essay is disorganized, with no clear introduction, body, or conclusion, and transitions between ideas are either nonexistent or very awkward. The language and word choice are inappropriate and inconsistent, and there are numerous grammatical errors, including problems with spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which significantly impede readability. Overall, the essay lacks clarity, practicality, real-world relevance, and linguistic precision, failing to meet the basic criteria of the guidelines provided. Improvements in content development, organization, language, and adherence to the prompt are necessary for a higher evaluation.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The arhuror concludes this story with this paragraph to show people that the story or people in the story have a thing for nature or like writing about nature like whats in nature the change or maybe this story is about nature at its best.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is quite disorganized and lacks clarity and practical focus. The thesis is unclear, and the content is not developed with concrete, real-world evidence or pragmatic reasoning. The argument about the story and nature is repetitive and vague, leaving the reader without a clear understanding of the author's point. Additionally, the conclusion does not effectively reinforce the thesis or provide practical implications. Structurally, the essay falls short of the expected standards. It lacks a coherent organization, with no clear introduction, body, or conclusion. Transitions between ideas are absent, making the essay difficult to follow. The language and style used are inappropriate for the audience and purpose; there are numerous grammatical errors, misspellings, and issues with punctuation and capitalization. Words are often misused, which further obscures the intended meaning. Overall, the essay needs significant revision to improve clarity, practicality, structure, and adherence to standard writing conventions.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concude the story with that paragraph because its what she solemely promoted herself.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: Upon reviewing the provided essay, it is evident that it lacks clarity, organization, and depth. The thesis statement is almost non-existent, and there is a lack of coherent development and support for any argument. The single sentence provided does not adequately introduce or conclude the topic, nor does it present a clear opinion or argument regarding the effects computers have on people or censorship in libraries. There are no real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning to support the writer\u2019s stance, which significantly weakens the content. Additionally, the sentence structure is awkward, with grammatical errors that hinder readability. The absence of transitional phrases and logical flow makes the essay difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on developing a clear thesis, supporting arguments with concrete examples, and ensuring grammatical accuracy while maintaining a structured and coherent narrative.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus \nby Minfong Ho \nSaeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng\nwalks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist\nshop to see if the plant can be purchased. \nIt was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat\nleaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in\nseemingly random profusion. \n\u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy\npotted plant by the corner. \nThere, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals\nsplayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of\nrecognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \n\u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. \nA saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with\nvermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into\nthe well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the\nbucket. \nSlowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,\noleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had\nnot even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. \nWhen she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and\ncool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. \nAnd beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with\npurplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to\nsee it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick\nwalls or between tiled roofs. \nAnd that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and\nfound a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.\n\u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said,\nsavoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its\ntag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d \nOne of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed\nher eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could\nalmost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she\ncombed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng\nwould help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. \nSaeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm\naround it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed\ncomb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? \nA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a\nchannel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. \nAnd in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. \nIt was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the\nlast remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.\nAs if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of\nthe onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to\nher. \nHer smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully.\n\u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed\nthe potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. \nMrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere\ndid you get it?\u201d \n\u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \n\u201cHow much?\u201d \nFor answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the \nLambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \n\u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \n\u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \n\u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this\nvegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed\nthe tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \n\u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. \nFor a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the\neye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. \nHer mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful\nplant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \n\u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the\nwords at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t\nas pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.\nThat\u2019s what matters.\u201d \nShe tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her\nother hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d \nShe went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The\nsoil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair\ntrailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There\nwas a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \n\u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. \nMrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and\nstart dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. \nLeft alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it.\nShe could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,\nthe sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth\nwatered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not\neven Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.\nBut she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. \nThe \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.\nOverhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng\nnow. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange\nbefore had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her\nnow. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against\nthe evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. \nWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the\ngeese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-4-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 4 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nRead the last paragraph of the story. \n\"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and\nthe geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.\" \nWrite a response that explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay provides the basic idea of why the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph, but it lacks the depth and specificity needed to fully address the prompt. Here are a few areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis needs to be clearer and more specific. Instead of saying \"to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started,\" try to articulate what exactly Saeng hopes to achieve and how the blooming hibiscus symbolizes her personal growth and determination.\n\n2. **Evidence and Examples**: While you quoted the last paragraph of the story, you need to incorporate more details and examples from the story to support your thesis. For instance, discuss how the hibiscus and other plants reminded Saeng of her childhood and her grandmother, and how this connection to her past fuels her determination to succeed in a new environment.\n\n3. **Organization**: Your essay would benefit from a more structured approach. Start with an introduction that presents your thesis statement, followed by body paragraphs that support your thesis with specific evidence from the story. Conclude with a paragraph that reinforces your main points and ties them back to the thesis.\n\n4. **Clarity and Grammar**: There are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that need to be addressed. For example, \"when the hibiscus start to grow back\" should be \"when the hibiscus starts to grow back,\" and \"when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building\" should be \"when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is blooming.\"\n\n5. **Real-World Relevance**: Try to draw connections between Saeng\u2019s experience and broader real-world themes related to resilience, adaptation, and personal growth. This will make your essay more practical and impactful.\n\nHere's an example of how you might revise a portion of your essay to incorporate these suggestions:\n\n**Revised Example**: \n\"The author concludes the story with Saeng vowing to retake her driver\u2019s test in the spring to symbolize her resilience and determination to adapt to her new life in America. When the hibiscus, a plant that holds deep personal significance for Saeng, begins to bloom again, it represents a renewal of hope and a connection to her cultural roots. Throughout the story, the hibiscus and other plants remind Saeng of her childhood in Vietnam and her grandmother, providing her with the emotional strength to face her challenges. By linking her decision to retake the test with the blooming of the hibiscus, the author emphasizes Saeng\u2019s journey of growth and her commitment to overcoming obstacles.\"\n\nBy focusing on these areas, you can create a more detailed, structured, and impactful essay that meets the criteria of the assignment. Keep up the effort, and continue to refine your writing to improve clarity and coherence.",

She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to\nher. \nHer smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully.\n\u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed\nthe potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. \nMrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere\ndid you get it?\u201d \n\u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \n\u201cHow much?\u201d \nFor answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the \nLambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \n\u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \n\u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \n\u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this\nvegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed\nthe tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \n\u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. \nFor a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the\neye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. \nHer mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful\nplant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \n\u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the\nwords at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t\nas pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.\nThat\u2019s what matters.\u201d \nShe tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her\nother hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d \nShe went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The\nsoil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair\ntrailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There\nwas a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \n\u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. \nMrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and\nstart dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. \nLeft alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it.\nShe could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,\nthe sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth\nwatered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not\neven Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.\nBut she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. \nThe \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.\nOverhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng\nnow. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange\nbefore had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her\nnow. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against\nthe evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. \nWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the\ngeese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-4-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 4 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nRead the last paragraph of the story. \n\"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and\nthe geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.\" \nWrite a response that explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.

        "llmResponse": "Thank you for your submission. You've started to capture the essence of Saeng's emotional journey, which is pivotal to understanding the story's conclusion. Here are some specific areas for improvement to enhance clarity, organization, and effectiveness:\n\n1. **Clear Thesis Statement**:\n   - Your response would benefit from a more explicit thesis statement that directly answers the prompt. For example, \"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's growing sense of familiarity and hope in her new environment, symbolized by her resolve to retake the test in the spring.\"\n\n2. **Use of Real-World Examples**:\n   - While you've touched on Saeng finding something that reminds her of her previous life, providing specific examples from the text will strengthen your argument. Mentioning the hibiscus plant and its significance to Saeng would add depth. For instance, \"The hibiscus plant reminds Saeng of her home in Vietnam, providing her with a sense of continuity and comfort in her new life.\"\n\n3. **Logical Organization**:\n   - Your response needs better structure to guide the reader through your argument. Consider breaking it into distinct parts: introduction (with thesis statement), body (with supporting examples), and conclusion. This will help maintain a clear and coherent flow.\n\n4. **Detailed Supporting Evidence**:\n   - Incorporate more details from the story to support your points. Discuss how the sight of familiar plants triggers memories of Saeng's grandmother and her past life, which helps her feel more at home and confident about her future.\n\n5. **Language and Grammar**:\n   - There are several grammatical errors that need attention. Ensure you use correct punctuation and complete sentences. For instance, \"now that she's found something that reminds her\" should be \"now that she has found something that reminds her.\"\n\n6. **Practical Suggestions for Improvement**:\n   - Revise your current sentence to be more detailed and grammatically correct. For example: \"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng, having found a hibiscus plant that reminds her of her old home, feels a renewed sense of hope and determination. This newfound connection to her past gives her the strength to retake the driving test in the spring, symbolizing her gradual adaptation to her new life.\"\n\nHere\u2019s a revised version of your paragraph incorporating these suggestions:\n\n\"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate Saeng's growing sense of familiarity and hope in her new environment. Finding the hibiscus plant, which reminds her of her life in Vietnam, provides her with a comforting connection to her past. This symbol of continuity gives Saeng the confidence to vow to retake the driving test in the spring, reflecting her gradual adaptation and determination to succeed in her new life.\"\n\nKeep practicing and refining your writing. With attention to detail and structure, your arguments will become clearer and more persuasive. Good job identifying the key elements of the story, and I look forward to seeing your improved drafts.",

The thesis statement is not clearly articulated, and the arguments are not well-developed or supported by specific examples. The structure is somewhat disjointed, with an abrupt transition from the mood discussion to the summary of Narciso Rodriguez's story. The essay's language and style contain several grammatical errors and misspellings, such as \"diffucult,\" \"depresing,\" and \"gratefull.\" Sentence structures are often awkward and lack variety. Additionally, the narrative flow is hindered by the absence of coherent transitions and well-defined topic sentences, making the essay difficult to follow. Overall, the essay needs significant improvement in clarity, organization, and the use of supporting evidence to effectively analyze the mood of the memoir.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 5 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Narciso Rodriguez \nfrom Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives \nMy parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a \nfurnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old \nNarciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon \ncall home. \nIn 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the \nIronbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our \ntraditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared \ncooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking \nthat is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which \nI adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of \nchildhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed \nboth, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. \nGrowing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \u201cfamily\u201d had nothing to do with \nbeing a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, \nCuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation \nprevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these \ncultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of \nhonest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their \nown kind, were clearly in need. \nOur landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and \nAlegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio \nand Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not \nknow my \u201creal\u201d grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were \nallowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and \nRosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family \nmembers came and went \u2014 and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they \nwere able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the \nmany people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. \nMy mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the \nlanguage or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a \nbetter life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country \nthey loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters \nwhile yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were \nstrong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind \nof jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had \nstudied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, \ntaking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their \nchildren to better times drove them to endure these hard times. \nI will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I\u2019ve often told them that what \nthey did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I\u2019ve often told them of \nmy admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I\u2019ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in \nreality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at \nsuch an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two \nlessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these \nteachings have been the basis of my life. \nIt was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to \nthis country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this \nhumble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not \njust scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of \u201cfamily.\u201d \nAnd for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I \nlearned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into \na home. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-5-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 5 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nDescribe the mood created by the author in the memoir.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay effectively identifies the heartwarming and appreciative mood of the memoir. However, there are several areas for improvement to better align with the assignment guidelines and enhance your overall writing clarity and coherence.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement**: Your essay lacks a clear and concise thesis statement. A strong thesis would help guide your analysis and provide a clear focus for your essay. Consider revising your introductory sentence to clearly state the mood created by the author and briefly outline the key points you will discuss.\n\n2. **Supporting Evidence**: While you have referenced the memoir, your use of quotes and specific examples could be more detailed and better integrated into your analysis. For instance, when you mention the sense of family and appreciation, provide more context from the memoir to support these observations. Explain how specific passages contribute to the overall mood.\n\n   - Example: \"Rodriguez illustrates the warmth of his home by describing the lively kitchen, where 'the aromas of the kitchen' and 'passionate Cuban music' created an inviting atmosphere.\"\n\n3. **Organization and Coherence**: Your essay would benefit from a more logical flow and clearer transitions between ideas. Ensure each paragraph focuses on a single point that supports your thesis, using well-defined topic sentences and smooth transitions.\n\n4. **Grammar and Clarity**: There are several grammatical errors and misspellings that need correction to improve readability. Pay attention to spelling, punctuation, and sentence structure.\n\n   - Corrected Example: \"Home and family are the most important things to all of us. The author creates a heartwarming and appreciative mood by illustrating how comfortable and joyful his home was with everyone together.\"\n\n5. **Vocabulary and Precision**: Use precise and varied vocabulary to avoid repetition and enhance your writing. Ensure that your language clearly conveys your analysis and observations.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion should effectively summarize your main points and reinforce the mood identified in the memoir. Make sure it ties back to your thesis and leaves the reader with a clear understanding of your analysis.\n\n   - Example: \"In conclusion, Rodriguez's memoir creates a heartwarming and appreciative mood through vivid descriptions of his home life and the sacrifices his parents made. The memoir highlights the importance of family, not just by blood, but through shared experiences and love.\"\n\nBy focusing on these areas, you can strengthen your analysis and produce a more coherent and compelling essay. Keep working on integrating detailed real-world examples, improving your grammar, and ensuring a logical flow to enhance the overall quality of your writing.",

But those books, movies, and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem. There are examples of how each catagory is in today's society.     Take the book 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', written by @PERSON1, for example. In that story, there are words that are used to describe people of that time.. Back when @PERSON1 wrote the book, it was perfectly fine to use those words on those people, but in today's modern world, that is a book that has been on the list for being banned. It is offensive to use that word on people today, so parent groups and others are trying to get that book pulled off of shelves in hopes of erasing what was done in the past. I don't believe that a book should be banned for it's content, but rather how well it teaches its reader through its words. If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and the culture of that time, then it shouldn't be banned at all. It should be read.     Movies have a rating system for a reason. There are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience. People must be of a certain age to rent, buy, or view these kind of movies 'leagally'. Not too many people listen to that system, even though it has exsisted for years. A horror film is not suitable for a @CAPS15 of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on @CAPS4. Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a @CAPS15 nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong. That is the fault of the parents. They were the ones who let their @CAPS15 watch that movie in the first place. So the movie shouldn't be held responsible for the @CAPS15. If the movie was intended for a more mature audience, that's the way it should stay.     And that brings us to music. There is a lot of music in today's age that can be considered very offensive. There are only a few 'pure' genres, free of the cursing that is used in many of the others today. But children, teen, and adults all find their favorite kind, and you can't change their minds then. The governement has issued that all music containing harsh words, horrid images to the mind, gruesome scenes, and other elements that are offensive to people, must carry a sticker on it. The black and white '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticker. When parents see this sticker on the @CAPS7, @NUM1 download, or whatever their @CAPS15 is using, then they know that it is more than likely not right for their @CAPS15 to listen to. Doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it means that there is a slight chance that their minds will not be tainted by 'garbage'.     So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't neccessarily mean that it is the same to another person. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society. People will still argue that books such as 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON2', '@CAPS10 in the @CAPS11', and many, many more books like them should be banned. They will always fight that movies such as 'A @CAPS12 on @CAPS13 @CAPS14,' '@DATE1 the @NUM2', or '@CAPS15's @CAPS16' should be removed from store shelves because it gave them nightmares as a @CAPS19 or it gives their @CAPS15 nightmares because they saw it. And they will always try to fight and say that artist like @CAPS17' @CAPS18, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS19 @CAPS20 are not suited for their @CAPS15. Well, this pattern has been going on for years. Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for a adult audience, not for a @CAPS15 of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue about what should be on shelves and what should not, remember that it might be that parent's fault for letting their @CAPS15 view it in the first place.",

Provide feedback that is aligned with the teacher's style and the class needs. Use all of the information at your disposable to customize to the teacher and class. Take the teacher instruction into account, in case they emphasize specifically what they want you to do.\n\n---------------------------\n\n----- TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is a persona of the teacher. Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.\n\n----- UPDATED TEACHER PERSONA -----\nAs an educator, my highest priority is to nurture and cultivate each student's ability to express themselves creatively and originally through their writing. I aim to provide an environment that encourages innovative thinking and rewards unique ideas, helping students feel confident in developing and presenting their thoughts in a way that showcases their individuality and imaginative perspectives. My teaching style is anchored in fostering originality and creative expression, creating a space where students are encouraged to take risks in their writing and explore new ideas without fear of judgment. \n\nI prioritize constructive feedback that inspires further thought and creativity, highlighting their unique and imaginative contributions before offering suggestions for improvement. My feedback focuses on clarity, effective organization, and the development of arguments, while also emphasizing the importance of varied and imaginative language. I strive to be approachable and supportive, engaging with students as individuals, understanding their unique perspectives, and encouraging them to express those perspectives confidently.\n\nMy feedback is tailored to each student's specific strengths and areas for growth, with a particular emphasis on enhancing their creative voice and ensuring grammatical accuracy. I value dialogue, inviting students to discuss their ideas with me and their peers, facilitating a collaborative and dynamic learning experience. I encourage students to build on their personal perspectives and experiences, ensuring their writing is both original and engaging.\n\nUltimately, my goal is to nurture an environment where creativity flourishes, original thinking is celebrated, and students feel empowered to push the boundaries of their expression. I aim to help students refine their writing by focusing on the clarity of their arguments, the coherence of their structure, and the originality of their ideas, all while maintaining a supportive and encouraging atmosphere.\n\n\n\n----- FEEDBACK -----\nHere are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: customer's as well. For instance think about a movie store. If the only movies sold were @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 there would be a lot less people wanting to go to that store, because then it just turns into a child's store.

The content is rich with specific details and examples, such as the comparison between book censorship and movie ratings, which effectively illustrate the writer's perspective. The organization, while coherent, could benefit from stronger transitions between paragraphs to enhance the overall flow and make the structure more engaging. The word choice is varied and suitable, effectively conveying the intended message with an appropriate level of precision. Sentence fluency is generally smooth, with a good mix of sentence structures that keep the reader engaged. However, some minor grammatical and spelling errors are present, which occasionally impede readability. Overall, the essay demonstrates a strong command of conventions, though attention to detail in proofreading would further improve its clarity and impact.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: ratings based on maturity content, so why shouldn't books.

The thesis, although somewhat traditional, is articulated clearly and is supported by relevant arguments and personal anecdotes. However, to enhance its effectiveness, the essay could benefit from a more engaging and imaginative introduction.

The black and white '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticker. When parents see this sticker on the @CAPS7, @NUM1 download, or whatever their @CAPS15 is using, then they know that it is more than likely not right for their @CAPS15 to listen to. Doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it means that there is a slight chance that their minds will not be tainted by 'garbage'.     So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't neccessarily mean that it is the same to another person. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society. People will still argue that books such as 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON2', '@CAPS10 in the @CAPS11', and many, many more books like them should be banned. They will always fight that movies such as 'A @CAPS12 on @CAPS13 @CAPS14,' '@DATE1 the @NUM2', or '@CAPS15's @CAPS16' should be removed from store shelves because it gave them nightmares as a @CAPS19 or it gives their @CAPS15 nightmares because they saw it. And they will always try to fight and say that artist like @CAPS17' @CAPS18, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS19 @CAPS20 are not suited for their @CAPS15. Well, this pattern has been going on for years. Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for a adult audience, not for a @CAPS15 of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue about what should be on shelves and what should not, remember that it might be that parent's fault for letting their @CAPS15 view it in the first place.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Your essay presents a strong argument against censorship in libraries and other media, bolstered by well-chosen examples and logical reasoning. Your stance is clear and well-articulated, reflecting a deep understanding of the complexities surrounding censorship.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Originality and Creativity:** Your essay showcases an original and creative approach to the topic, particularly in how you draw parallels between books, movies, and music. This comparative method effectively highlights the overarching issue of censorship across different media.\n2. **Detailed Examples:** The inclusion of specific works like \"The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1\" and the discussion about the historical context of language use are insightful. These examples help anchor your argument in real-world instances, making it more compelling.\n3. **Engagement:** Your writing style is engaging and captures the reader\u2019s attention. You have a unique voice that shines through, making your argument both personal and persuasive.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n1. **Clarity and Organization:** While your ideas are strong, the essay would benefit from clearer transitions between paragraphs and sections. For example, the shift from books to movies to music feels a bit abrupt. Introducing a brief connecting sentence or phrase could enhance the flow.\n2. **Grammar and Spelling:** There are several minor grammatical and spelling errors throughout the essay, such as \"neccessarily\" instead of \"necessarily\" and \"exsisted\" instead of \"existed.\" Careful proofreading can help eliminate these distractions. Additionally, correcting placeholders like \"@CAPS1\" and \"@CAPS2\" will improve readability.\n3. **Sentence Fluency:** Some sentences are a bit lengthy and could be broken down for better readability. For instance, \"Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a @CAPS15 nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong\" could be made more concise.\n4. **Stronger Conclusion:** Your conclusion effectively reiterates your main points but could be strengthened by offering a more innovative perspective or a call to action. This would leave a more lasting impression on the reader.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- **Transitions:** To enhance coherence, consider using transitional phrases like \"Moreover,\" \"In addition,\" or \"On the other hand\" to guide your reader through your points smoothly.\n- **Proofreading:** Allocate time to review your essay for minor errors. Reading aloud can often help identify awkward phrasing or mistakes that might be overlooked when reading silently.\n- **Expanding Ideas:** Provide a bit more explanation for some of your points. For example, when discussing the historical context of offensive language, delve deeper into why understanding this context is crucial for modern readers.\n\nOverall, your essay demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and reflects your unique voice and creativity. With some refinement in organization and attention to detail in grammar and spelling, your argument will be even more compelling. Keep pushing the boundaries of your expression and continue to explore new ideas confidently. Excellent work!",

Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to discuss the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the story. The ideas are underdeveloped and the content is minimal, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the intended message. There is a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points being made, which weakens the overall argument. The response also tends to wander off-topic and does not adhere closely to the prompt. The language used is simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors, such as \"shes\" instead of \"she's\" and \"sentance\" instead of \"sentence.\" These errors distract from the readability of the essay and hinder its effectiveness. Additionally, the essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes the narrative difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing detailed support from the story, maintaining clarity in addressing the prompt, enhancing vocabulary, and ensuring a smooth flow of ideas with proper transitions.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: According to @PERSON1, economic @CAPS1, every hour you spend on the computer, you raise your electricity bill by @MONEY2. The average @CAPS2 spends @NUM1 hours on the computer everyday. I believe that spending too much time on the computer could be a bad thing. You have economic loss from the electric bill, health loss because you won't be able to exercise as much, and community less because you won't spen as much with your community. Financial loss is something that many people are concerned\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and focused argument against excessive computer use, supported by recognizable main ideas: financial loss, health issues, and community disintegration. The originality of the thesis could be improved by providing a more unique or thought-provoking perspective on the topic. The essay is satisfactorily organized, with a basic introduction, body, and conclusion, though the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow of ideas. The word choice effectively conveys the intended message, but there is room for more varied and imaginative language to make the essay more engaging. The sentences generally flow well, though some constructions could be more fluid and varied to maintain the reader\u2019s interest. The essay demonstrates control of standard writing conventions, but there are noticeable errors in spelling and grammar that slightly impede readability. Overall, the essay is clear and persuasive but could benefit from more creative expression and polished language use to fully align with the teacher's emphasis on originality and creative expression.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: loss there is also a health issue. Many people are talking about how americans are becoming obise. Part @MONEY1 this is due to spending too much time on the computer. Proffesor @CAPS3 @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 says that, \"the obisety in @LOCATION1 is a problem, if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, that problem would be solved.\" @CAPS4, @NUM5 out @MONEY1 @NUM6 people are obese. If everyone spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, it would become @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM6.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and focused argument against excessive computer use, supported by recognizable main ideas: financial loss, health issues, and community disintegration.

Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 3 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit \nby Joe Kurmaskie \nFORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece \nof advice for the solo cyclist would be, \u201cNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers \nwho haven\u2019t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.\u201d It\u2019s not that a group of \nold guys doesn\u2019t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid \nplace. Things change. \nAt a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer \nevening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn\u2019t have done was \nlet them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice \nand launched out at first light along a \u201cshortcut\u201d that was to slice away hours from my ride to \nYosemite National Park. \nThey\u2019d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I \nwould come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with \nstrong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first \u201ctown.\u201d \nThis place might have been a thriving little spot at one time\u2014say, before the last world war\u2014but \non that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water \nsupply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool \npines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. \nTwenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, \nand a corral that couldn\u2019t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had \nbeen hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of \nCalifornia in June. \nI got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my \nstrength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the \nneighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water \nwouldn\u2019t cool down. It didn\u2019t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. \nThe old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make \nthat! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so\u2014a test of my inner spirit. \nNot two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was \nreplaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign \njumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. \nThe speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so \ncruel. \nI toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake\u2014it \nreally did look like a diamondback\u2014blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased \npast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. \nThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my \nshirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June \nsimply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn\u2019t been off their porch in decades, \ncaused me to laugh. \nIt was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. \nThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride \ndown into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I\u2019d \nbe fine. \nOver one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make \nsure it wasn\u2019t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst \nof energy, I maneuvered down the hill. \nIn an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building\u2014abandoned years \nearlier, by the looks of it\u2014had been a Welch\u2019s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A \nsandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still \nbe seen. \nI hung my head. \nThat smoky blues tune \u201cSummertime\u201d rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating \nbrain. \nI got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. \nI\u2019d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you \nhave left to circulate. With any luck I\u2019d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. \nIt didn\u2019t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some \nexpensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and \ntheir keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I \nwas going to lose consciousness for the last time. \nSomehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining \nelevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear \nwere all behind me. \nGARY AND WILBER\u2019S FISH CAMP\u2014IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE\u2019RE \nYOUR BEST BET! \n\u201cAnd the only bet,\u201d I remember thinking. \nAs I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an \noverwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait\u2014any bait, even \nthough I didn\u2019t own a rod or reel. \nAn old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from \nmy head as I slumped against the wall beside him. \n\u201cWhere you headed in such a hurry?\u201d \n\u201cYosemite,\u201d I whispered. \n\u201cKnow the best way to get there?\u201d \nI watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group \nI\u2019d listened to in Lodi. \n\u201cYes, sir! I own a very good map.\u201d \nAnd I promised myself right then that I\u2019d always stick to it in the future. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-3-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 3 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nWrite a response that explains how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.

For instance, consider elaborating on how the hills specifically impacted his physical and mental endurance. How did the \"water-depleting\" pace affect his overall journey?\n2. **Integration of Quotes:** When integrating quotes, aim for a smoother transition and ensure they enhance your argument. The quote about the speed limit, for example, could be more seamlessly woven into your analysis to highlight how the cyclist's slow pace contributed to his frustration and exhaustion.\n3. **Conclusion:** Your concluding sentence could be more impactful and reflective.

Additionally, while your vocabulary is appropriate and varied, further refinement in word choice could add more precision and interest to your writing.\n\nYour sentence structures are varied and mostly effective, contributing to a smooth reading experience. Still, addressing some repetitive phrases and minor grammatical errors would elevate the overall quality. For instance, consistent capitalization, punctuation, and spelling accuracy are essential for clear communication, even though creative deviations are acceptable. \n\nOverall, your essay is engaging and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. With some improvements in organization and attention to detail in language use, your writing will be even more impactful and enjoyable to read.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to discuss the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the story. The ideas are underdeveloped and the content is minimal, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the intended message. There is a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points being made, which weakens the overall argument. The response also tends to wander off-topic and does not adhere closely to the prompt. The language used is simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors, such as \"shes\" instead of \"she's\" and \"sentance\" instead of \"sentence.\" These errors distract from the readability of the essay and hinder its effectiveness. Additionally, the essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes the narrative difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing detailed support from the story, maintaining clarity in addressing the prompt, enhancing vocabulary, and ensuring a smooth flow of ideas with proper transitions.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

For example the road, the rocks everything close. The cyclist needs to know everything about where he's going, because if not then he can run into some problems along the way, For example like snakes, rough terrain, rocks in the way. That why its important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves. That why when you see cyclist you see them around, a road where theres cars around, just in case they get into trouble.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Your essay provides a good starting point in exploring how the features of the setting affect the cyclist during his journey. You\u2019ve identified various elements like the road conditions, the presence of rocks, and potential encounters with snakes, which are all relevant to the cyclist's experience. This shows that you have a clear understanding of the text and its setting, which is a strong foundation.\n\nHowever, to enhance your essay and make it more engaging, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Expand Your Examples**: While you\u2019ve mentioned some features like the road and rocks, it would be beneficial to delve deeper into specific examples from the text. For instance, you could describe how the cyclist's water supply depleting in the high desert affected his journey, or how the abandoned Welch\u2019s Grape Juice factory he encountered added to his despair.\n\n2. **Organize Your Ideas**: Structuring your essay into distinct paragraphs can help improve readability. You might begin with an introduction that briefly outlines the main challenges faced by the cyclist, followed by separate paragraphs that elaborate on each point with supporting evidence from the text.\n\n3. **Clarify and Refine Your Language**: There are a few areas where refining your vocabulary and sentence structures could enhance clarity and interest. For example, instead of saying \"the road, the rocks everything close,\" you could say \"the treacherous road conditions and the sharp, scattered rocks.\" This not only provides more vivid imagery but also makes your writing more engaging.\n\n4. **Grammatical Accuracy**: Pay attention to grammar and punctuation to ensure your ideas are communicated clearly. For instance, \"That why its important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves\" should be corrected to \"That's why it's important for a cyclist to trust their own instincts.\"\n\n5. **Engage with the Text's Themes**: Reflect on how the setting not only poses physical challenges but also tests the cyclist\u2019s mental and emotional endurance. This will add depth to your analysis and show a nuanced understanding of the text.\n\nHere's a revised version of your paragraph to illustrate these suggestions:\n\n\"The features of the setting profoundly impact the cyclist in many ways. The rough terrain, with its sharp rocks and unpredictable conditions, poses significant physical challenges. For instance, the cyclist's encounter with a large snake blocking the road and the discovery of an abandoned ghost town highlight the isolation and danger of the journey. Moreover, the high desert heat and the scarcity of drinkable water test his endurance and resourcefulness. These examples underscore the importance of self-reliance for a cyclist, as relying on outdated or misguided advice can lead to perilous situations. This is why cyclists often stay close to well-traveled roads where help is readily available should they encounter trouble.\"\n\nOverall, your essay captures the essence of the cyclist's struggle with his environment. With some additional development and refinement, your writing will become even more compelling and insightful. Keep pushing the boundaries of your expression, and remember, your unique perspective is your greatest strength",

Provide feedback that is aligned with the teacher's style and the class needs. Use all of the information at your disposable to customize to the teacher and class. Take the teacher instruction into account, in case they emphasize specifically what they want you to do.\n\n---------------------------\n\n----- TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is a persona of the teacher. Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.\n\n----- UPDATED TEACHER PERSONA -----\nAs an educator, my highest priority is to nurture and cultivate each student's ability to express themselves creatively and originally through their writing. I aim to provide an environment that encourages innovative thinking and rewards unique ideas, helping students feel confident in developing and presenting their thoughts in a way that showcases their individuality and imaginative perspectives.

My feedback focuses on clarity, effective organization, and the development of arguments, while also emphasizing the importance of varied and imaginative language. I strive to be approachable and supportive, engaging with students as individuals, understanding their unique perspectives, and encouraging them to express those perspectives confidently.\n\nMy feedback is tailored to each student's specific strengths and areas for growth, with a particular emphasis on enhancing their creative voice and ensuring grammatical accuracy. I value dialogue, inviting students to discuss their ideas with me and their peers, facilitating a collaborative and dynamic learning experience. I encourage students to build on their personal perspectives and experiences, ensuring their writing is both original and engaging.\n\nUltimately, my goal is to nurture an environment where creativity flourishes, original thinking is celebrated, and students feel empowered to push the boundaries of their expression. I aim to help students refine their writing by focusing on the clarity of their arguments, the coherence of their structure, and the originality of their ideas, all while maintaining a supportive and encouraging atmosphere.\n\n\n\n----- FEEDBACK -----\nHere are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: outside they don't talk to there friends or even see ther friends its mostly not haven a life. And people dont feel like going to school because their over and there tired and ther just want to use the computer all day with not stopping. And so i think that people are just to addicted to compulers they dont use it for the fright reasons. Had then people get sick they could get hoadaks or they feel like puking. And they dont get to see that of things like go to the @CAPS1, @CAPS2 football,\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates an attempt to discuss the impact of computer usage on individuals, but it lacks clarity and effective organization. The main ideas are present but not fully developed or supported with specific details, making the overall argument somewhat simplistic and broad. The essay's structure is disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a need for a clearer flow of ideas. The language used is repetitive and often inappropriate, with many words misused or misspelled, which detracts significantly from the intended message. Sentence structures are awkward and lack fluidity, causing the reader to frequently pause and reread for comprehension. Additionally, the essay contains numerous grammatical errors, incorrect punctuation, and inconsistent capitalization, which further impede readability. However, there are moments of creative expression, and the writer's point of view is clearly stated, though it requires more refinement and stronger support to be more persuasive and engaging. Improving these areas with a focus on originality and imaginative language use, while maintaining grammatical accuracy, will enhance the overall quality of the essay.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to discuss the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the story. The ideas are underdeveloped and the content is minimal, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the intended message. There is a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points being made, which weakens the overall argument. The response also tends to wander off-topic and does not adhere closely to the prompt. The language used is simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors, such as \"shes\" instead of \"she's\" and \"sentance\" instead of \"sentence.\" These errors distract from the readability of the essay and hinder its effectiveness. Additionally, the essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes the narrative difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing detailed support from the story, maintaining clarity in addressing the prompt, enhancing vocabulary, and ensuring a smooth flow of ideas with proper transitions.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: loss there is also a health issue. Many people are talking about how americans are becoming obise. Part @MONEY1 this is due to spending too much time on the computer. Proffesor @CAPS3 @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 says that, \"the obisety in @LOCATION1 is a problem, if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, that problem would be solved.\" @CAPS4, @NUM5 out @MONEY1 @NUM6 people are obese. If everyone spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, it would become @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM6.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and focused argument against excessive computer use, supported by recognizable main ideas: financial loss, health issues, and community disintegration. The originality of the thesis could be improved by providing a more unique or thought-provoking perspective on the topic. The essay is satisfactorily organized, with a basic introduction, body, and conclusion, though the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow of ideas. The word choice effectively conveys the intended message, but there is room for more varied and imaginative language to make the essay more engaging. The sentences generally flow well, though some constructions could be more fluid and varied to maintain the reader\u2019s interest. The essay demonstrates control of standard writing conventions, but there are noticeable errors in spelling and grammar that slightly impede readability. Overall, the essay is clear and persuasive but could benefit from more creative expression and polished language use to fully align with the teacher's emphasis on originality and creative expression.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isn\u0092t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Your essay does a good job of introducing how the setting affects the cyclist, and you have some interesting points that highlight the relationship between physical surroundings and the rider's experience. I appreciate your effort to draw a clear connection between the environment and the cyclist's state of mind and physical condition. This is a solid foundation that can be built upon to create a more compelling narrative. Let's work on enhancing your argument with more specific examples and varied language to make your writing more engaging and detailed.\n\nFirstly, it's important to provide specific examples from the source text to support your claims. For instance, you mention that a challenging setting can cause the cyclist more pain and dehydration. You could elaborate on this by referencing the part of the text where the cyclist struggles with the rough terrain and lack of water. Including direct quotes or detailed descriptions from the text will strengthen your argument and show a deeper understanding of the source material.\n\nSecondly, let's work on making your language more varied and imaginative. Instead of saying \"nice\" or \"not nice,\" you could describe the settings more vividly. For example, \"If the setting is serene and picturesque, it allows the rider to immerse in the beauty around them, thus distracting from any physical discomfort.\" Similarly, for a challenging setting, you might say, \"A harsh, barren landscape exacerbates the rider's physical strain, making every pedal stroke a test of endurance.\"\n\nAdditionally, while your points are clear, the organization of your essay can be improved to create a smoother flow of ideas. Consider starting with a brief introduction that outlines the main points you will discuss. Then, dedicate each paragraph to a specific aspect of the setting's impact on the cyclist, supported by examples from the text. This structure will make your essay easier to follow and more persuasive.\n\nLastly, be mindful of your grammar and punctuation. Ensure that each sentence starts with a capital letter and that your sentences are varied in structure to maintain the reader's interest. For example, instead of repeating \"the cyclist could could,\" you might say, \"the cyclist could become increasingly dehydrated, compounding their physical challenges.\"\n\nYour essay has great potential, and with a few adjustments, it can truly shine. Keep exploring your creative voice and don't hesitate to take risks with your language and ideas. I'm excited to see how you will refine and develop this piece further. Keep up the excellent work!",

Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to discuss the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the story. The ideas are underdeveloped and the content is minimal, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the intended message. There is a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points being made, which weakens the overall argument. The response also tends to wander off-topic and does not adhere closely to the prompt. The language used is simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors, such as \"shes\" instead of \"she's\" and \"sentance\" instead of \"sentence.\" These errors distract from the readability of the essay and hinder its effectiveness. Additionally, the essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes the narrative difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing detailed support from the story, maintaining clarity in addressing the prompt, enhancing vocabulary, and ensuring a smooth flow of ideas with proper transitions.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: he really has a family, that show they care. He appreciates what his parents have done for him. You can tell his very greatful because of the way he expresses himself about his family. \"In reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spint of generosity impressed upon me, and demonstrate of how important family and friends are\". He is a caring young boy.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a genuine effort to explore the theme of family gratitude in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, but it lacks the originality and creative expression that could elevate it. While it includes specific quotations from the memoir, the analysis remains superficial and doesn't delve deeply into the unique aspects of Rodriguez's experiences or emotions. The introduction could be more engaging, and the body paragraphs would benefit from smoother transitions and more innovative development of arguments. The vocabulary and sentence structures are fairly basic, and there are several grammatical errors, such as inconsistencies in the spelling of \"grateful\" and issues with punctuation and capitalization. Additionally, the essay could improve its narrative flow by enhancing the use of transitional words and providing a more conversational tone. Overall, while the essay addresses some of the key points from the memoir, it would benefit from a more creative approach and a deeper analysis to fully capture the essence of Rodriguez's gratitude towards his family.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: c.The mood in this passage Narciso Rodriguez's home, nationality, and his family. He often talks about his nationality. He is proud to be born in Cuba and not afraid to say it. He is also married. He lives in the @DATE1's. In america. He also often talks about his @NUM1 bedroom apartment in Newark, New Jersey. He aslo likes to talk about the new freinds he mad here. And his family. Also Narciso childhood. His neighborhood is made out of cubans, And @CAPS1. That was the memoir of this passage.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a minimal understanding of the content about Narciso Rodriguez's background and experiences. While it mentions his Cuban nationality and pride, as well as his residence in Newark and family dynamics, it lacks specificity and depth in its supporting arguments. The response does not effectively utilize evidence from the memoir to strengthen its points, leading to a surface-level engagement with the topic. In terms of language, the essay demonstrates adequate grammar and spelling, with some minor errors and a limited range of vocabulary. The structure is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of cohesive flow between ideas, making it challenging to follow the narrative smoothly. Enhancing the originality and creativity in the development of the thesis, supporting arguments, and conclusion would greatly improve the overall quality of the essay. Additionally, incorporating a more engaging introduction and imaginative use of language and sentence structures would elevate the essay's appeal.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus \nby Minfong Ho \nSaeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng\nwalks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist\nshop to see if the plant can be purchased. \nIt was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat\nleaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in\nseemingly random profusion. \n\u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy\npotted plant by the corner. \nThere, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals\nsplayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of\nrecognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \n\u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. \nA saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with\nvermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into\nthe well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the\nbucket. \nSlowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,\noleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had\nnot even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. \nWhen she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and\ncool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. \nAnd beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with\npurplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to\nsee it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick\nwalls or between tiled roofs. \nAnd that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and\nfound a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.\n\u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said,\nsavoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its\ntag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d \nOne of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed\nher eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could\nalmost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she\ncombed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng\nwould help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. \nSaeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm\naround it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed\ncomb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? \nA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a\nchannel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. \nAnd in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. \nIt was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the\nlast remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.\nAs if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of\nthe onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to\nher. \nHer smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully.\n\u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed\nthe potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. \nMrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere\ndid you get it?\u201d \n\u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \n\u201cHow much?\u201d \nFor answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the \nLambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \n\u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \n\u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \n\u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this\nvegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed\nthe tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \n\u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. \nFor a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the\neye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. \nHer mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful\nplant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \n\u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the\nwords at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t\nas pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.\nThat\u2019s what matters.\u201d \nShe tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her\nother hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d \nShe went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The\nsoil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair\ntrailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There\nwas a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \n\u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. \nMrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and\nstart dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. \nLeft alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it.\nShe could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,\nthe sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth\nwatered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not\neven Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.\nBut she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. \nThe \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.\nOverhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng\nnow. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange\nbefore had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her\nnow. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against\nthe evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. \nWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the\ngeese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-4-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 4 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nRead the last paragraph of the story. \n\"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and\nthe geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.\" \nWrite a response that explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.

That is why she is waiting till spring to try again.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Your response touches on the central theme of Saeng\u2019s struggle to adapt to her new environment while holding on to memories of her homeland. You've identified an important aspect of Saeng's journey\u2014her determination to keep trying, despite her longing for her old home. This is a great start and shows a good grasp of the character's emotions.\n\nTo further enhance your essay, consider adding more detailed examples from the story to support your points. For instance, you could discuss specific moments when Saeng feels a connection to her past, like when she recognizes the hibiscus or smells the jasmine. These examples would enrich your argument and provide a clearer picture of her inner conflict and resilience.\n\nAdditionally, expanding your vocabulary and varying your sentence structures can make your writing more engaging. Instead of saying, \"Saeng is trying to be ok with her new home,\" you might try, \"Saeng grapples with her sense of displacement as she endeavors to embrace her new surroundings.\" This not only adds depth but also enhances the reader\u2019s experience.\n\nAlso, your essay could benefit from a more structured approach. Start with an engaging introduction that sets the tone for your analysis, followed by body paragraphs that each focus on a specific aspect of Saeng's struggle, and conclude with a reflective summary that ties all your points together.\n\nFinally, ensure your grammar and spelling are accurate to maintain readability. For example, \"She is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home\" could be more powerfully expressed as \"She remains steadfast in her efforts to acclimate to her new home.\"\n\nRemember, your unique perspective and creative expression are what make your writing special. Keep pushing the boundaries of your ideas and exploring new ways to articulate them. Excellent effort, and I look forward to seeing how you further develop your thoughts!",

With the great Cuban music and cuisine, his family, friends and the many celebrations, he painted a vivid image of fun and comfort. Next, he describes his neighborhood. With the many diverse cultures of all the immigrants, they work together, and kindness prevailed. The community would always extend their hands to one who was down on their luck. Third, he describes his friends and family who visited often. Their landlord and his daughter, Alegria; his surrogate grandparents Sergio and Edelmira; His aunts Bertha and Juanita; his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary; the list goes on. His parents let all who needed a home to stay with them, because they knew that the others would help them if they needed shelter.

His parents left behind friends, family, and their good jobs to start anew in @LOCATION3, also that he would live a better life than they.

Narciso is very thankful and feels very much beloved in his family. In the mood in this memoir is not just thoughtful or kind or caring, it's the feeling loved and loving that feeling. \"It was here where I learned the real definition of family.\"\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a warm and heartfelt narrative of the author's family life, emphasizing the values of courage, love, and community. However, it lacks a clear and original thesis statement, which makes it challenging to grasp the central argument or unique perspective the writer aims to convey. The essay wanders at times, leading to a sense of disjointedness, especially in how the introduction and body paragraphs transition. The vocabulary is varied, but there are notable grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures that detract from the overall flow and coherence. While the narrative is somewhat engaging, it could benefit from more strategic use of transitional phrases to create a smoother reading experience. Additionally, while the memoir's essence is captured, more specific and consistent evidence from the provided excerpt would strengthen the arguments and maintain focus throughout the essay. Overall, the essay demonstrates potential but requires more refinement in structure, clarity, and adherence to the provided prompt.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

After living for a year in a \nfurnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old \nNarciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon \ncall home. \nIn 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the \nIronbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our \ntraditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared \ncooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking \nthat is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which \nI adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of \nchildhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed \nboth, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. \nGrowing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \u201cfamily\u201d had nothing to do with \nbeing a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, \nCuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation \nprevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these \ncultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of \nhonest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their \nown kind, were clearly in need. \nOur landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and \nAlegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio \nand Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not \nknow my \u201creal\u201d grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were \nallowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and \nRosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family \nmembers came and went \u2014 and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they \nwere able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the \nmany people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. \nMy mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the \nlanguage or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a \nbetter life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country \nthey loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters \nwhile yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were \nstrong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind \nof jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had \nstudied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, \ntaking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their \nchildren to better times drove them to endure these hard times. \nI will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I\u2019ve often told them that what \nthey did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I\u2019ve often told them of \nmy admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I\u2019ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in \nreality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at \nsuch an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two \nlessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these \nteachings have been the basis of my life. \nIt was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to \nthis country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this \nhumble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not \njust scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of \u201cfamily.\u201d \nAnd for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I \nlearned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into \na home. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-5-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 5 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nDescribe the mood created by the author in the memoir.

First, he described his childhood home. With the great Cuban music and cuisine, his family, friends and the many celebrations, he painted a vivid image of fun and comfort. Next, he describes his neighborhood. With the many diverse cultures of all the immigrants, they work together, and kindness prevailed. The community would always extend their hands to one who was down on their luck. Third, he describes his friends and family who visited often. Their landlord and his daughter, Alegria; his surrogate grandparents Sergio and Edelmira; His aunts Bertha and Juanita; his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary; the list goes on. His parents let all who needed a home to stay with them, because they knew that the others would help them if they needed shelter. Finally Narciso described the hardships and sacrifices his parents made for him, for which he is eternally grateful. His parents left behind friends, family, and their good jobs to start anew in @LOCATION3, also that he would live a better life than they. Because of this writing style; because of his vivid imagery; Narciso Rodriguez wrote an article that is not only pleasing to read, but that it also touches the heart.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Your essay does a commendable job of capturing the warm and familial atmosphere that Narciso Rodriguez creates in his memoir. The organization of your paragraphs, each focusing on different aspects of Rodriguez's life and the mood he portrays, shows a clear structure and logical progression in your ideas. You've effectively highlighted the vivid imagery Rodriguez uses to depict his childhood home, neighborhood, and the sacrifices of his parents, which indeed creates a touching narrative.\n\nHowever, let's elevate your essay further by incorporating more originality and deeper analysis. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Engage More Deeply with the Text**: While you\u2019ve done well to outline the main points, try to delve deeper into how these elements interact to establish the mood. For instance, how does the Cuban music and cuisine specifically contribute to the sense of comfort and belonging? Elaborate on how the cultural diversity in his neighborhood not only reflects kindness but also resilience and unity, especially in the face of overt racism and segregation.\n\n2. **Enhance Your Creative Expression**: Your essay would benefit from a more varied and imaginative use of language. Experiment with more descriptive adjectives and vivid verbs to bring your narrative to life. For example, instead of saying \"he described his childhood home,\" you might write \"Rodriguez vividly transports us to his childhood haven, where the air was perfumed with the rich aromas of Cuban cuisine and the rhythmic beats of passionate music.\"\n\n3. **Strengthen Transitions and Flow**: While your essay is well-organized, consider using more transitional phrases to ensure a smoother flow between paragraphs. Phrases like \"Moreover,\" \"In addition,\" or \"Furthermore\" can help guide the reader through your arguments seamlessly.\n\n4. **Refine Your Conclusion**: The conclusion is clear and touches on all the points discussed, but it can be more impactful. Summarize not just that the article is pleasing to read and touches the heart, but also reflect on the broader implications of Rodriguez's narrative. How does his story of family, sacrifice, and community resonate with or inspire the reader?\n\n5. **Proofread for Minor Errors**: There are minor grammatical errors such as \"Narciso described,\" which should be \"Narciso describes,\" to maintain consistency in tense. Also, ensure correct punctuation and capitalization throughout.\n\nIn essence, your essay has strong foundational elements, and with a bit of fine-tuning and a more creative approach, it can truly shine. I\u2019m excited to see how you further develop your unique voice and analytical skills. Keep pushing the boundaries of your expression!\n\nFeel free to discuss any of these points further if you need additional guidance.",
