Take the teacher instruction into account, in case they emphasize specifically what they want you to do.\n\n---------------------------\n\n----- TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is a persona of the teacher. Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.\n\n### Teacher Persona\n\n- **High Priority Goal:**\n  - Develop students' ability to construct well-reasoned, evidence-based arguments.\n  - Teach precise and robust thesis statement crafting.\n  - Guide logical structuring of essays with clear transitions and well-defined topic sentences.\n  - Ensure substantial evidence and logically sound reasoning support arguments.\n  - Emphasize technical precision and linguistic correctness.\n  - Encourage appropriate use of technical terminology and clear sentence structures.\n  - Focus on grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization.\n  - Equip students with skills for effective and persuasive communication in writing and broader academic pursuits.\n\n- **Teaching Style:**\n  - Strong emphasis on evidence-based arguments and logical reasoning.\n\n- **Feedback Approach:**\n  - **Content:**\n    - Prioritize clarity and precision of thesis statements.\n    - Ensure robust support of arguments with substantial evidence and logical reasoning.\n    - Enhance the effectiveness of conclusions.\n    - Point out where arguments could be more clearly articulated and where additional data or factual support is needed.\n    - Improve synthesis of information in conclusions.\n  - **Organization:**\n    - Value clear and logical structure.\n    - Address coherence of transitions and clarity of topic sentences.\n    - Provide suggestions for improving readability and logical progression through rearrangement or rephrasing.\n  - **Language and Style:**\n    - Emphasize appropriateness and precision of technical terminology.\n    - Encourage the use of precise vocabulary and construction of complex yet clear sentences.\n    - Include recommendations for vocabulary enhancement and sentence restructuring.\n  - **Conventions:**\n    - Meticulously check for grammatical accuracy, correct spelling, punctuation, and capitalization.\n    - Provide detailed corrections and explanations to help students understand and avoid future errors.\n\n- **Overall Approach:**\n  - Comprehensive feedback addressing content, organization, language, style, and conventions.\n  - Create a supportive and intellectually stimulating environment.\n  - Encourage critical thinking, clear and logical writing, and constant refinement of academic skills.\n  - Help students excel in current assignments and develop skills for future academic and professional success.\n\n\n\n----- FEEDBACK -----\nHere are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 people use computers but not every one agress that it benefits society. In my opinion, computers benefit society. There are @CAPS1 websites that can help you find information. Computers also allow people to work easily. A third reason is @CAPS1 companies are able to use them to gain business. If you are doing a project or need to look up information about something, the internet is one of the easiest ways to find that information. Google.com has so much information\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: This essay presents a clear stance on the benefits of computers to society and supports the thesis with relevant examples and logical reasoning. However, the thesis could be more precise to provide a stronger foundation for the argument. The essay is well-organized, with clear transitions between points, although the topic sentences could be more defined to enhance readability. The use of language is mostly effective, but there are moments where vocabulary could be more varied and precise to convey the intended message more powerfully. Sentence structures are generally clear and varied, contributing to a smooth flow of ideas. On the other hand, the essay has several minor grammatical errors and some issues with capitalization, which slightly impede the overall readability. Strengthening the thesis statement, refining topic sentences, and correcting grammatical errors would further enhance the clarity, structure, and content of this essay.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 these days are telling kids to go outside instead of vegging out in front of a computer. Computers can but promote bad habits. I try not to use the computer unless I have too for school or to get homework. Please consider the negative effects which are exercising in apropprate content and less interaction with friends/family. Yes internets can be used to find diets and exercise plans but if you would just go to the gym to burn of those pounds everything would be just fine!\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a clear stance on the negative effects of computer usage, primarily focusing on issues such as lack of exercise, exposure to inappropriate content, and reduced social interactions. However, the thesis statement lacks precision and clarity, and the arguments, though supported by personal anecdotes, are not substantiated with substantial evidence or data. The logical progression of ideas is somewhat present but fragmented, impacting the overall coherence. The structure of the essay could benefit from better-defined topic sentences and smoother transitions between paragraphs. The vocabulary used is appropriate, though there are areas where word choice could be more precise to enhance the overall message. Sentence structures are varied but occasionally awkward, which disrupts the flow of the essay. Grammatical errors, incorrect spelling, and punctuation issues are present but do not severely impede readability. Overall, while the essay conveys a personal perspective on the topic, it would benefit from stronger organization, clearer thesis articulation, and more robust evidence-based support to effectively persuade the reader.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: all you have to do is make one and then you can print out one-hundred. Using computers helps society. you can easily find what you are looking for and you are able talk to anyone you want. Also, it is easy for companies to attract business. Those are only a few of the @CAPS1 reasons why computers are good for society.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: This essay presents a clear stance on the benefits of computers to society and supports the thesis with relevant examples and logical reasoning.

        "llmResponse": "Dear Student,\n\nYour essay demonstrates an attempt to engage with the topic of the impact of computers on society, and you have included several points to support your viewpoint. Let's work on refining and strengthening your argument to make it more compelling and effective.\n\n### Content:\n1. **Thesis Statement:** Your thesis statement is somewhat unclear. A well-defined thesis should clearly express your main argument. Consider revising it to something more precise and focused, such as: \"Computers significantly benefit modern society by providing easy access to information, facilitating communication, and enhancing productivity.\"\n\n2. **Supporting Evidence:** While you mention several benefits of computers, such as looking up information and chatting with friends and family, the support for these points is somewhat general. Strengthen your arguments by including specific examples or data to make your points more convincing. For instance, you could cite statistics on how computers have improved educational outcomes or how they aid in professional networking.\n\n### Organization:\n1. **Structure:** The structure of your essay needs clearer organization. Each paragraph should begin with a strong topic sentence that introduces the main idea of that paragraph. Ensure that each paragraph focuses on a single point, and use transitions to link your ideas smoothly. For example, start with a topic sentence like, \"One major benefit of computers is the easy access to vast amounts of information.\"\n\n2. **Flow and Coherence:** Improve the logical progression of your ideas. Ensure that each paragraph builds on the previous one, creating a cohesive argument. For example, after discussing the ease of finding information, you could transition to how this information accessibility supports education and professional development.\n\n### Language and Style:\n1. **Precision and Vocabulary:** Enhance your vocabulary to make your essay more engaging and precise. Avoid vague terms and aim for more specific language. For instance, instead of saying \"look up places,\" you could say \"access detailed geographical information and directions.\"\n\n2. **Sentence Structure:** Vary your sentence structure to maintain the reader's interest and enhance the flow of your essay. Combine short sentences with longer, more complex ones to create a rhythmic flow.\n\n### Conventions:\n1. **Grammar and Spelling:** There are several grammatical errors and spelling mistakes that need attention. For example, \"dident\" should be \"didn't,\" \"reseach\" should be \"research,\" and \"oppinion\" should be \"opinion.\" Careful proofreading is essential to avoid these errors.\n\n2. **Punctuation and Capitalization:** Ensure correct punctuation and capitalization throughout your essay. For instance, \"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1,\" should not have a comma after \"Dear,\" and \"Computers\" should not be capitalized unless it is the start of a sentence or a proper noun.\n\n### Conclusion:\nYour conclusion should succinctly summarize your main points and reinforce your thesis. It currently lacks clarity and impact. Consider revising it to effectively close your argument, such as: \"In conclusion, computers play an indispensable role in today's society by enabling access to information",

I believe that even if books, music, movies or magazines on the bookshelves are offense, they should still be left there. They are apart of our history and the history we're creating.

The central argument\u2014that censorship is futile given technological access and potentially harmful to community dynamics\u2014is reasonably well-articulated, though it could benefit from more specific and detailed support. The essay lacks a cohesive structure, with ideas presented in a somewhat disjointed manner. Clearer transitions and a more organized flow of arguments would enhance readability and effectiveness. The vocabulary used is appropriate and conveys the intended message, though there are some areas where more precise language could strengthen the argument. Sentence structures are varied but occasionally awkward, disrupting the overall fluidity of the text. While the essay demonstrates a good command of basic writing conventions, a few grammatical errors and inconsistencies (such as \"i've\" instead of \"I've\") need attention.

However, the thesis lacks precision and could benefit from a more focused statement of purpose. The arguments presented are somewhat repetitive and underdeveloped, lacking substantial evidence or logical reasoning to support the proposed solution. The essay is disorganized, with ideas not flowing logically from one to the next. Transitions between paragraphs are weak, making it difficult to follow the argument. The language used is simplistic and contains numerous spelling and grammatical errors, which detract from the essay's overall effectiveness. Additionally, the sentence structures are often awkward and unclear, further impeding readability. To improve, the essay needs a clearer thesis, better-developed arguments supported by concrete evidence, a more logical organization, varied and precise word choice, and meticulous proofreading to correct language conventions.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

These materials @MONTH1 not be offensive to some people, but it can be to others. They can be against some peoples religion and way of life.     I have read some books outside of my school library that I think should not be found on a library shelf. Now they are putting those same books in libraries. These books have violence and inappropriate behavior in them. Are these books you want your children to be reading?      There are even movies that are like those books. Many shows are based of a book series, and that series @MONTH1 not be a good one. The series can contain violence that can influence kids and teenagers. The kids could see something they think is really neat on the @CAPS1 and then go out and try that. They do not understand that what they do @MONTH1 not be a good thing. They could get into a lot more trouble then they want to get in.     I know there are some materials on the shelves that many people say are offensive and really are not offensive at all. In my opinion, the worst ones should be put away and only adults should be able to get them. After that, the adults can choose whether or not their children should watch them.     There are some that would agree with my opinion and some that would not. What do you think? Do you want your children watching or reading something bad that could influence the rest of their lives in a bad way? Would you want them to grow up believing that what they see in movies and read in books is all good? Or do you want them to know what they should and should not do?\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Your essay takes a clear stance on the issue of censorship in libraries, emphasizing the potential harm of offensive materials. This is a complex and nuanced topic, and you bring forward some important considerations. Let's work on refining your argument and enhancing the overall clarity and effectiveness of your essay.\n\n### Content:\n1. **Clarity of Thesis**: Your thesis could benefit from more precision. Instead of \"I do believe we should not have overly offensive materials on the shelves,\" try to articulate the specific criteria or types of materials you think should be censored. This will help your readers understand your stance more clearly.\n\n2. **Supporting Evidence**: Your argument would be stronger with more specific evidence. For example, mentioning specific books, movies, or examples of the content you find offensive and explaining why they are problematic would make your argument more compelling.\n\n3. **Logical Reasoning**: While you touch on several important points, such as the potential influence of violent media on children, these points need to be expanded and supported with research or logical reasoning. For example, citing studies that demonstrate the impact of violent media on behavior would strengthen your argument.\n\n### Organization:\n1. **Structure and Flow**: Your essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Introduce your thesis at the beginning, followed by distinct paragraphs that each present a single point supporting your thesis. Use clear topic sentences to guide the reader through your arguments.\n\n2. **Transitions**: The transitions between your paragraphs need to be smoother to enhance the flow of your essay. For instance, transitioning from discussing books to movies could be done with a sentence that connects the two ideas.\n\n### Language and Style:\n1. **Technical Terminology**: Use precise terminology when discussing censorship, media influence, and other key concepts. This will make your argument more authoritative.\n\n2. **Vocabulary**: Vary your word choice to avoid repetition and make your writing more engaging. For example, instead of repeatedly saying \"offensive,\" you could use synonyms such as \"inappropriate,\" \"harmful,\" or \"disturbing.\"\n\n3. **Sentence Structure**: Aim for varied sentence structures to improve readability and maintain the reader's interest. Try to combine shorter sentences with more complex ones to create a natural flow.\n\n### Conventions:\n1. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are a few grammatical errors and typos that need attention. For example, \"@MONTH1\" and \"@CAPS1\" appear to be placeholders and should be replaced with appropriate words. Also, \"then\" should be \"than\" in \"trouble then they want to get in.\"\n\n2. **Punctuation and Capitalization**: Ensure that all punctuation and capitalization are correct. For example, \"based of\" should be \"based on,\" and \"peoples\" should be \"people's.\"\n\n### Overall:\nYour essay presents a valid perspective on the issue of censorship, but it requires more precise articulation, stronger evidence, and a clearer structure to be fully persuasive.

The thesis is somewhat clear, but the arguments supporting it are not sufficiently developed with concrete evidence or logical reasoning. The brief quotes provided from the source text are relevant but are not adequately integrated into the essay to enhance the argument. Additionally, the essay needs a more robust conclusion that synthesizes the points discussed. The organization is basic, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, but it lacks coherent transitions and well-defined topic sentences, which makes the flow of ideas somewhat choppy. The language used is simplistic and contains several grammatical errors, such as punctuation mistakes and improper use of capitalization, which detract from the overall readability and effectiveness. To improve, the essay should incorporate more substantial evidence from the text, use precise and varied vocabulary, and ensure grammatical accuracy to enhance clarity and impact.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay on the cyclist\u2019s experience conveys the main idea but lacks depth and detail.

They had to dismiss many hardships such as lack of water, being lost, immense desert heat, plus minor things like snakes and road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June was the most intense hardship. That and the lack of water. Though the heat starting powing at the cyclists\u0092 brain by making them see mirages, etc. The heat and entire setting made the cyclists\u0092 travel much harder.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a general overview of the cyclist's hardships during their journey through the California desert, mentioning issues such as extreme heat, lack of water, and challenging terrain. While the central idea is identifiable, it lacks depth and specificity, requiring more substantial evidence and detailed examples to bolster the main points. The essay's organization is somewhat disjointed, with ideas not fully fleshed out or logically connected, leading to a lack of smooth narrative flow. Transitional phrases and topic sentences are sparse, which hampers the coherence and fluidity of the text. Furthermore, the language used is basic and occasionally imprecise, with some grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures that detract from the overall readability. Enhancing the clarity of arguments, providing more detailed examples, and polishing the language would significantly improve the effectiveness of the essay.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 3 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit \nby Joe Kurmaskie \nFORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece \nof advice for the solo cyclist would be, \u201cNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers \nwho haven\u2019t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.\u201d It\u2019s not that a group of \nold guys doesn\u2019t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid \nplace. Things change. \nAt a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer \nevening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn\u2019t have done was \nlet them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice \nand launched out at first light along a \u201cshortcut\u201d that was to slice away hours from my ride to \nYosemite National Park. \nThey\u2019d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I \nwould come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with \nstrong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first \u201ctown.\u201d \nThis place might have been a thriving little spot at one time\u2014say, before the last world war\u2014but \non that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water \nsupply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool \npines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. \nTwenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, \nand a corral that couldn\u2019t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had \nbeen hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of \nCalifornia in June. \nI got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my \nstrength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the \nneighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water \nwouldn\u2019t cool down. It didn\u2019t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. \nThe old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make \nthat! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so\u2014a test of my inner spirit. \nNot two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was \nreplaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign \njumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. \nThe speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so \ncruel. \nI toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake\u2014it \nreally did look like a diamondback\u2014blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased \npast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. \nThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my \nshirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June \nsimply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn\u2019t been off their porch in decades, \ncaused me to laugh. \nIt was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. \nThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride \ndown into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I\u2019d \nbe fine. \nOver one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make \nsure it wasn\u2019t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst \nof energy, I maneuvered down the hill. \nIn an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building\u2014abandoned years \nearlier, by the looks of it\u2014had been a Welch\u2019s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A \nsandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still \nbe seen. \nI hung my head. \nThat smoky blues tune \u201cSummertime\u201d rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating \nbrain. \nI got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. \nI\u2019d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you \nhave left to circulate. With any luck I\u2019d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. \nIt didn\u2019t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some \nexpensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and \ntheir keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I \nwas going to lose consciousness for the last time. \nSomehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining \nelevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear \nwere all behind me. \nGARY AND WILBER\u2019S FISH CAMP\u2014IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE\u2019RE \nYOUR BEST BET! \n\u201cAnd the only bet,\u201d I remember thinking. \nAs I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an \noverwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait\u2014any bait, even \nthough I didn\u2019t own a rod or reel. \nAn old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from \nmy head as I slumped against the wall beside him. \n\u201cWhere you headed in such a hurry?\u201d \n\u201cYosemite,\u201d I whispered. \n\u201cKnow the best way to get there?\u201d \nI watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group \nI\u2019d listened to in Lodi. \n\u201cYes, sir! I own a very good map.\u201d \nAnd I promised myself right then that I\u2019d always stick to it in the future. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-3-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 3 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nWrite a response that explains how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.

        "llmResponse": "The essay begins to touch on the critical effect of the setting on the cyclist, but it requires more depth and specificity to fully address the prompt. The thesis is present but rather vague; it needs to be more precise and robust to clearly convey the relationship between the setting and the cyclist's experience. \n\nTo strengthen the essay, consider expanding on how the harsh conditions of the high desert, the lack of water, and the extreme heat influenced not only the cyclist's physical state but also his mental state and decision-making process. For example, you could reference specific moments from the source text where the cyclist describes the brackish water tasting like battery acid and his encounter with the ghost town, which illustrate the severity of his situation.\n\nThe organization would benefit from clearer transitions and more defined topic sentences to guide the reader through your argument. Each paragraph should start with a topic sentence that introduces the specific aspect of the setting being discussed and how it affects the cyclist.\n\nIn terms of language and style, aim for more precise vocabulary and complex sentence structures. This will enhance clarity and make your argument more compelling. Additionally, ensure that your spelling, punctuation, and capitalization are accurate to improve readability and professionalism.\n\nOverall, the essay has the potential to meet the assignment's requirements effectively. By incorporating more substantial evidence from the text, clearly articulating your arguments, and refining your language, your essay will better demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of how the setting impacts the cyclist. Keep working on these areas, and you'll see significant improvement in your writing.",

Also the girl wants to overcome her obstacle at a certain time.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents an attempt to answer the prompt; however, it falls short in several key areas. The thesis of the essay lacks clarity and precision, making it difficult for the reader to grasp the main argument being presented. The points made are somewhat vague and not well supported with specific evidence or logical reasoning. There are no examples or details from the story to substantiate the claims, leaving the arguments unconvincing. Additionally, the structure of the essay is disjointed. There is an absence of coherent transitions and well-defined topic sentences, which disrupts the logical flow of ideas and makes the narrative hard to follow. The language and style are not suitable for an academic essay, with several grammatical errors, incorrect punctuation, and awkward sentence structures that hinder readability. Technical terminology is not utilized effectively, leading to a lack of precision and variety in vocabulary. Overall, the essay needs significant improvement in content development, organization, and language use to meet the standards of evidence-based argumentation and logical reasoning.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: What Saeng means at the end of the paragraph is that where it is a seasson for those plants she will take the test again. The test to begin to like like the plot. Like features and characters about. Also the history about these plants.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is significantly lacking in clarity, structure, and content coherence. The central idea of what Saeng means at the end of the paragraph is not clear, and the arguments presented are vague and unsupported by any substantial evidence or logical reasoning. The essay is exceptionally brief and does not offer a concrete thesis or any developed arguments. The sentences are fragmented, and there is a noticeable absence of transitional phrases and logical progression, making it difficult to follow the writer's train of thought. Additionally, the vocabulary is not used effectively, and the language is simplistic and imprecise. Grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, and spelling mistakes further impede the readability of the essay. Overall, the essay does not meet the expectations for a well-reasoned, evidence-based argument and falls short in all evaluated categories. It is crucial to develop a clear thesis, provide detailed and logical support for arguments, ensure smooth transitions, and maintain grammatical accuracy for future submissions.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: simple house into a home.\", what this means is that he is greatful for the life he had. So he will never forget the gratitude that fills him up inside.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the memoir's main theme of gratitude, with specific references to Narciso Rodriguez\u2019s experiences and emotions towards his parents. The thesis is reasonably clear, focused on the idea of gratitude, and supported with relevant examples from the memoir. However, the clarity of the thesis could be enhanced with a more precise statement at the beginning. The structure of the essay shows logical progression, with well-defined paragraphs and a coherent flow of ideas, though some transitions could be smoother to enhance readability. The use of technical terminology and vocabulary is appropriate, and the sentence structures are varied and generally correct, though there are minor grammatical errors that could be refined for higher precision. The conclusion effectively synthesizes the arguments presented, reinforcing the theme of gratitude and the impact of the parents' sacrifices on the author's life. Overall, the essay is engaging and maintains the reader's interest, with good use of evidence from the memoir to support its points. To improve, the essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement, smoother transitions, and minor grammatical corrections.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus \nby Minfong Ho \nSaeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng\nwalks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist\nshop to see if the plant can be purchased. \nIt was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat\nleaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in\nseemingly random profusion. \n\u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy\npotted plant by the corner. \nThere, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals\nsplayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of\nrecognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \n\u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. \nA saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with\nvermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into\nthe well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the\nbucket. \nSlowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,\noleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had\nnot even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. \nWhen she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and\ncool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. \nAnd beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with\npurplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to\nsee it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick\nwalls or between tiled roofs. \nAnd that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and\nfound a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.\n\u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said,\nsavoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its\ntag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d \nOne of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed\nher eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could\nalmost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she\ncombed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng\nwould help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. \nSaeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm\naround it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed\ncomb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? \nA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a\nchannel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. \nAnd in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. \nIt was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the\nlast remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.\nAs if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of\nthe onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to\nher. \nHer smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully.\n\u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed\nthe potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. \nMrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere\ndid you get it?\u201d \n\u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \n\u201cHow much?\u201d \nFor answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the \nLambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \n\u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \n\u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \n\u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this\nvegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed\nthe tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \n\u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. \nFor a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the\neye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. \nHer mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful\nplant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \n\u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the\nwords at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t\nas pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.\nThat\u2019s what matters.\u201d \nShe tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her\nother hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d \nShe went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The\nsoil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair\ntrailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There\nwas a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \n\u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. \nMrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and\nstart dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. \nLeft alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it.\nShe could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,\nthe sizzle of hot oil in the pan.

Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange\nbefore had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her\nnow. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against\nthe evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. \nWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the\ngeese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-4-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 4 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nRead the last paragraph of the story. \n\"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and\nthe geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.\" \nWrite a response that explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.

        "llmResponse": "### Teacher Feedback\n\n**Content:**\n\nYour response to the prompt is extremely brief and does not adequately address the question asked. The statement \"So she did not forget to take the test again\" is too vague and lacking in detail. To improve your answer, you should explain why Saeng vowing to take the test again in the spring is significant to the story. Consider how this moment reflects her determination, emotional growth, or connection to her heritage. Make sure to include specific examples or details from the story to support your points.\n\n**Prompt Adherence:**\n\nWhile your response does acknowledge Saeng\u2019s intention to retake the test, it falls short in explaining why this is an important conclusion to the story. The prompt requires a detailed explanation, including examples from the narrative to illustrate your understanding. To better adhere to the prompt, provide a comprehensive analysis that shows how this resolution ties in with the story's themes and character development.\n\n**Organization:**\n\nYour statement lacks the necessary structure to convey a well-reasoned argument. A clear thesis statement followed by supporting sentences would greatly enhance the readability and logical flow of your response. Begin by stating why the conclusion is significant, then provide specific examples from the text to substantiate your argument, and finally, conclude with a synthesis of your points.\n\n**Language and Style:**\n\nYour language is overly simplistic and does not utilize the technical terminology or varied vocabulary expected at this academic level. Aim to construct more complex sentences and use precise vocabulary that articulates your understanding of the text. \n\n**Conventions:**\n\nThe simplicity of your response means that grammatical errors are minimal; however, longer and more complex sentences would likely reveal areas where grammar and punctuation need attention. As you expand your response, carefully check for grammatical accuracy, correct spelling, and appropriate punctuation to ensure clarity and precision.\n\n### Overall Recommendations:\n\n- **Expand Your Response:** Provide a more detailed explanation of why Saeng\u2019s vow to retake the test is crucial to understanding the story\u2019s conclusion.\n- **Use Evidence:** Support your points with specific examples and details from the text.\n- **Enhance Clarity:** Start with a clear thesis, use well-defined topic sentences, and ensure smooth transitions between ideas.\n- **Improve Vocabulary:** Utilize a broader range of vocabulary and technical terminology to articulate your points more effectively.\n- **Check Conventions:** Pay attention to grammar, punctuation, and spelling to maintain a high standard of technical precision.\n\nWith these improvements, your essay will better reflect a well-reasoned, evidence-based argument that aligns with the expectations of this assignment. Keep striving for clarity, precision, and logical structure in your writing.",

So he will\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a clear understanding of the memoir's main theme of gratitude, with specific references to Narciso Rodriguez\u2019s experiences and emotions towards his parents. The thesis is reasonably clear, focused on the idea of gratitude, and supported with relevant examples from the memoir. However, the clarity of the thesis could be enhanced with a more precise statement at the beginning. The structure of the essay shows logical progression, with well-defined paragraphs and a coherent flow of ideas, though some transitions could be smoother to enhance readability. The use of technical terminology and vocabulary is appropriate, and the sentence structures are varied and generally correct, though there are minor grammatical errors that could be refined for higher precision. The conclusion effectively synthesizes the arguments presented, reinforcing the theme of gratitude and the impact of the parents' sacrifices on the author's life. Overall, the essay is engaging and maintains the reader's interest, with good use of evidence from the memoir to support its points. To improve, the essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement, smoother transitions, and minor grammatical corrections.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created by the author in this memoir was nostalgic. @PERSON1 remembers all the happy times he had, and memories that took place in his home. In paragraph two, he reflects back on how in his traditional Cuban home, where the heart was the kitchen.

In paragraph three and four, he tells how the\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay effectively captures the nostalgic mood of the memoir through detailed reflections on the author's memories with substantial evidence drawn directly from the text. The clear and well-supported thesis regarding the nostalgic atmosphere is consistently backed by specific examples, such as the vivid descriptions of the Cuban kitchen, the familial gatherings, and the cultural solidarity in the neighborhood. The narrative flows logically from one point to the next, with each paragraph building on the previous one to create a cohesive and compelling story. Moreover, the use of technical terminology and a varied, precise vocabulary enhances the readability and depth of the essay. The sentence structures are complex yet clear, contributing to an engaging and sophisticated writing style. Additionally, the essay maintains grammatical accuracy, with minimal errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, ensuring that the content is delivered effectively. Overall, the essay demonstrates a strong alignment with the guidelines, showcasing evidence-based arguments, logical progression, and linguistic precision.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful. The author proved that it doesn't take the amount of money, or how big your house is to be happy. Sometimes its just the simple things. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, \"my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" The author is showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood, they still treat each other as if they were.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a general understanding of the memoir's themes, but it lacks a precise and clear thesis statement, resulting in an overall vague argument. While there are some references to specific passages in the memoir, they are not well integrated into the argument, and the connection between the evidence and the points being made is not sufficiently established. The structure of the essay is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of coherent flow from one idea to the next. Additionally, the use of language is basic, with limited vocabulary and several grammatical errors that detract from the overall readability and effectiveness of the essay. The narrative struggles to hold the reader's interest due to its repetitive nature and lack of engaging storytelling techniques. To improve, the essay should focus on developing a clear thesis, integrating evidence seamlessly into the argument, enhancing the logical flow with better transitions, and refining language use to be more varied and precise.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 5 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Narciso Rodriguez \nfrom Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives \nMy parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a \nfurnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old \nNarciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon \ncall home. \nIn 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the \nIronbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our \ntraditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared \ncooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking \nthat is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which \nI adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of \nchildhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed \nboth, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. \nGrowing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \u201cfamily\u201d had nothing to do with \nbeing a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, \nCuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation \nprevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these \ncultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of \nhonest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their \nown kind, were clearly in need. \nOur landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and \nAlegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio \nand Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not \nknow my \u201creal\u201d grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were \nallowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and \nRosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family \nmembers came and went \u2014 and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they \nwere able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the \nmany people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. \nMy mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the \nlanguage or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a \nbetter life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country \nthey loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters \nwhile yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were \nstrong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind \nof jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had \nstudied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, \ntaking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their \nchildren to better times drove them to endure these hard times. \nI will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I\u2019ve often told them that what \nthey did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I\u2019ve often told them of \nmy admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I\u2019ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in \nreality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at \nsuch an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two \nlessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these \nteachings have been the basis of my life. \nIt was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to \nthis country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this \nhumble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not \njust scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of \u201cfamily.\u201d \nAnd for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I \nlearned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into \na home. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-5-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 5 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nDescribe the mood created by the author in the memoir.

        "llmResponse": "The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the memoir's themes, particularly highlighting the parents' sacrifices and the author's pride and gratitude. However, there are several areas that need improvement to align more closely with the guidelines and enhance the overall quality of the essay.\n\n**Content and Prompt Adherence:**\nWhile you've identified some key themes, such as the parents' sacrifices and the author's gratitude, the thesis statement remains unclear. You mention multiple moods\u2014grateful, proud\u2014but it's important to choose the primary mood and clearly articulate it in a concise thesis statement. Additionally, your evidence should be more specific and directly tied to your points. For example, citing particular phrases or sentences from the memoir to support your claims would strengthen your argument.\n\n**Organization:**\nThe structure of your essay could benefit from clearer organization. Begin with a strong thesis statement that clearly identifies the primary mood. Each paragraph should start with a topic sentence that introduces the main idea of the paragraph. Ensure that your ideas flow logically from one to the next, using smooth transitions to guide the reader.\n\n**Language and Style:**\nYour vocabulary and sentence structure are somewhat basic. To improve readability and engagement, try incorporating more varied and precise vocabulary. Additionally, work on constructing more complex sentences that still remain clear. For example, instead of \"they let people live at there house,\" you could say, \"They generously opened their home to those in need, demonstrating their unwavering hospitality.\"\n\n**Conventions:**\nThere are several grammatical errors throughout your essay, including issues with subject-verb agreement, verb tense, and punctuation. For instance, \"there\" should be \"their,\" and \"the didnt have much money\" should be \"they didn't have much money.\" Carefully proofread your work to correct these errors, as they can distract from the overall effectiveness of your writing.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n1. Craft a clear and precise thesis statement at the beginning of your essay.\n2. Organize your paragraphs with clear topic sentences and logical transitions.\n3. Use specific examples and evidence from the memoir to support your points.\n4. Enhance your vocabulary and sentence structure for better clarity and engagement.\n5. Meticulously proofread your work to eliminate grammatical errors.\n\nOverall, your essay shows an understanding of the memoir's themes, but it needs a clearer thesis, better organization, and more precise language to effectively convey your argument. Keep working on these areas to improve your writing skills and create a more compelling essay.",

The thesis is reasonably clear, focused on the idea of gratitude, and supported with relevant examples from the memoir. However, the clarity of the thesis could be enhanced with a more precise statement at the beginning. The structure of the essay shows logical progression, with well-defined paragraphs and a coherent flow of ideas, though some transitions could be smoother to enhance readability. The use of technical terminology and vocabulary is appropriate, and the sentence structures are varied and generally correct, though there are minor grammatical errors that could be refined for higher precision. The conclusion effectively synthesizes the arguments presented, reinforcing the theme of gratitude and the impact of the parents' sacrifices on the author's life. Overall, the essay is engaging and maintains the reader's interest, with good use of evidence from the memoir to support its points. To improve, the essay could benefit from a clearer thesis statement, smoother transitions, and minor grammatical corrections.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful. The author proved that it doesn't take the amount of money, or how big your house is to be happy. Sometimes its just the simple things. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, \"my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" The author is showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood, they still treat each other as if they were.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a general understanding of the memoir's themes, but it lacks a precise and clear thesis statement, resulting in an overall vague argument. While there are some references to specific passages in the memoir, they are not well integrated into the argument, and the connection between the evidence and the points being made is not sufficiently established. The structure of the essay is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of coherent flow from one idea to the next. Additionally, the use of language is basic, with limited vocabulary and several grammatical errors that detract from the overall readability and effectiveness of the essay. The narrative struggles to hold the reader's interest due to its repetitive nature and lack of engaging storytelling techniques. To improve, the essay should focus on developing a clear thesis, integrating evidence seamlessly into the argument, enhancing the logical flow with better transitions, and refining language use to be more varied and precise.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created by the author in this memoir was nostalgic. @PERSON1 remembers all the happy times he had, and memories that took place in his home. In paragraph two, he reflects back on how in his traditional Cuban home, where the heart was the kitchen. He remembers his parents love for cooking, and how eternally grateful he is it got passed down to him. @PERSON1 remembers the passionate Cuban music mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. In paragraph three and four, he tells how the\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay effectively captures the nostalgic mood of the memoir through detailed reflections on the author's memories with substantial evidence drawn directly from the text. The clear and well-supported thesis regarding the nostalgic atmosphere is consistently backed by specific examples, such as the vivid descriptions of the Cuban kitchen, the familial gatherings, and the cultural solidarity in the neighborhood. The narrative flows logically from one point to the next, with each paragraph building on the previous one to create a cohesive and compelling story. Moreover, the use of technical terminology and a varied, precise vocabulary enhances the readability and depth of the essay. The sentence structures are complex yet clear, contributing to an engaging and sophisticated writing style. Additionally, the essay maintains grammatical accuracy, with minimal errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, ensuring that the content is delivered effectively. Overall, the essay demonstrates a strong alignment with the guidelines, showcasing evidence-based arguments, logical progression, and linguistic precision.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

After living for a year in a \nfurnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old \nNarciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon \ncall home. \nIn 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the \nIronbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our \ntraditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared \ncooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking \nthat is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which \nI adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of \nchildhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed \nboth, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. \nGrowing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \u201cfamily\u201d had nothing to do with \nbeing a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, \nCuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation \nprevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these \ncultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of \nhonest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their \nown kind, were clearly in need. \nOur landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and \nAlegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio \nand Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not \nknow my \u201creal\u201d grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were \nallowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and \nRosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family \nmembers came and went \u2014 and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they \nwere able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the \nmany people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. \nMy mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the \nlanguage or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a \nbetter life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country \nthey loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters \nwhile yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were \nstrong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind \nof jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had \nstudied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, \ntaking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their \nchildren to better times drove them to endure these hard times. \nI will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I\u2019ve often told them that what \nthey did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I\u2019ve often told them of \nmy admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I\u2019ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in \nreality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at \nsuch an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two \nlessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these \nteachings have been the basis of my life. \nIt was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to \nthis country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this \nhumble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not \njust scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of \u201cfamily.\u201d \nAnd for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I \nlearned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into \na home. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-5-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 5 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nDescribe the mood created by the author in the memoir.

        "llmResponse": "Thank you for your effort in analyzing the mood in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir. There are several strengths in your essay that I'd like to highlight, along with some areas for improvement.\n\n### Strengths:\n\n1. **Understanding of the Memoir's Theme:** You clearly identify the mood of gratitude in the memoir and provide quotes that support this mood. Your chosen passages effectively illustrate Rodriguez's feelings towards his parents.\n2. **Engagement with the Text:** Your essay shows engagement with the source material, as you have selected relevant quotes from the memoir to back up your points.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n\n1. **Thesis Statement Clarity:**\n   - Your thesis statement could be more precise. Instead of broadly saying, \"The mood created in the memoir is grateful,\" consider refining it to something like, \"The memoir by Narciso Rodriguez vividly portrays a mood of deep gratitude towards his parents for their sacrifices and teachings.\"\n\n2. **Integration of Evidence:**\n   - While you have included relevant quotes, these need to be better integrated into your argument. For example, after each quote, provide a more detailed analysis of how it supports the mood of gratitude. Avoid phrases like \"What I mean by that is\"; instead, directly connect the evidence to your argument.\n   - Example: \"Rodriguez states, 'My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today.' This illustrates his gratitude for the valuable life skills and passion his parents instilled in him through their everyday actions.\"\n\n3. **Structure and Transitions:**\n   - The essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Start with an introduction that presents your thesis, followed by body paragraphs that each focus on a specific aspect of the gratitude mood, and conclude with a synthesis of your main points.\n   - Ensure smooth transitions between ideas to enhance readability. For instance, instead of abruptly moving from one quote to another, use linking sentences that explain how the points are related.\n\n4. **Language and Sentence Structure:**\n   - Aim for more varied and precise vocabulary. Words like \"cherish\" and \"cares\" are repeated and could be replaced with synonyms like \"values\" and \"adores\" to add variety.\n   - Address grammatical issues and ensure technical precision. For instance, correct capitalization errors such as \"Parents\" should be \"parents,\" and ensure words like \"unwrittingly\" are spelled correctly (\"unwittingly\").\n\n5. **Conventions:**\n   - Pay close attention to grammatical accuracy, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Errors like \"besis\" should be corrected to \"basis,\" and ensure all sentences are punctuated correctly.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nOverall, your essay provides a good starting point for discussing the mood of gratitude in Rodriguez's memoir. By refining your thesis statement, integrating evidence more effectively, improving structural coherence, and enhancing language precision, you can significantly strengthen your argument and align more closely",

I think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. A computer can be used for communication, education, and for accessing important information quickly, such as the local news. Now, let me tell you why computers are good for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a friend who I was very close to and a part of his life. Unfortunately, he had to move away. But I still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while. A convenient way to do this was by using a computer. The computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can @CAPS5 stay in touch. Different types of communication on the computer can be e-mail, instant-messaging, video chat, online chat groups...etc. This helps people stay connected. That's why I think communication is the biggest effect on people due to the use of a computer. But, a computer can also be used for learning. At school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals. For example when my class researched different things about the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, our main source of infromation was the internet on our computers. We researched the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. Also, kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it. This is teaching them hand-eye coordiantion, and how to type. The computer is not @CAPS5 used for just communication. It's a good way to educate everyone although the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information. \"@CAPS6 and adults often check their e-mail and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy, \"says expert @PERSON1. I think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what's going on in our town, state, country, and world. For example, it can tell us about the series of shootings goiong on throughout @LOCATION1 or the many house robberies in our town. Us, @CAPS7 citizens, wnt to know everything... for us to stay safe and notified on the latest. Another example is that I logged on the computer three dats ago and it notified me about the earthquake in @LOCATION2. But there are so many benefits of a computer. The effects computers have on people are beneficial. It allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news. I think you should take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone.",

I think the effects computers have on people are beneficial for everyone who uses one. A computer can be used for communication, education, and for accessing important information quickly, such as the local news. Now, let me tell you why computers are good for communication. When I was in elementary school, I had a friend who I was very close to and a part of his life. Unfortunately, he had to move away. But I still wanted to continue to be friends and communicate with him every once in a while. A convenient way to do this was by using a computer. The computer allows you to easily contact an old friend so that you can @CAPS5 stay in touch. Different types of communication on the computer can be e-mail, instant-messaging, video chat, online chat groups...etc. This helps people stay connected. That's why I think communication is the biggest effect on people due to the use of a computer. But, a computer can also be used for learning. At school or work, both kids and adults need access to the right information about research projects, vacation spots, learning about animals, food, cultures, and sometimes things as complicated as scientific chemicals. For example when my class researched different things about the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, our main source of infromation was the internet on our computers. We researched the customs, the foods, the way of dressing, the traditional holidays, and their way of entertainment. Also, kids come home from school and upload their essay and continue to type it. This is teaching them hand-eye coordiantion, and how to type. The computer is not @CAPS5 used for just communication. It's a good way to educate everyone although the internet can be used to pass along important local and global information. \"@CAPS6 and adults often check their e-mail and homepage everyday for the latest news on other countries, our country, the government, and the economy, \"says expert @PERSON1. I think that the internet gives citizens a fast and easy way to access information about what's going on in our town, state, country, and world. For example, it can tell us about the series of shootings goiong on throughout @LOCATION1 or the many house robberies in our town. Us, @CAPS7 citizens, wnt to know everything... for us to stay safe and notified on the latest. Another example is that I logged on the computer three dats ago and it notified me about the earthquake in @LOCATION2. But there are so many benefits of a computer. The effects computers have on people are beneficial. It allows people to stay in touch, learn about places and people, and to stay up to date with the latest local and global news. I think you should take my ideas into consideration and publish them for everyone.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Dear [Student's Name],\n\nYour essay presents a compelling and heartfelt argument about the beneficial effects of computers on society. You've done an excellent job of capturing the reader's attention with your engaging personal anecdotes and clear, focused thesis statement. Your effort to share personal experiences, such as staying in touch with a friend who moved away, adds a deep emotional connection to your writing, which is precisely what we aim for in our class.\n\n**Thesis and Emotional Impact:**\nYour thesis is clearly articulated, stating that computers have a beneficial impact on users, and you effectively support this with well-chosen examples. The personal story about maintaining a friendship despite geographical distance is particularly evocative, helping to create an emotional resonance that will likely engage your readers deeply.\n\n**Supporting Details and Organization:**\nYour essay is well-organized with a clear flow of ideas. Each paragraph effectively builds on the previous one, maintaining a logical structure that makes your argument easy to follow. Your use of specific examples, such as researching the customs of the [CAPS3 CAPS4] and accessing local news, provides strong, relevant support for your points. These details are well-suited to your audience and purpose, making your writing both credible and relatable.\n\n**Emotional Journey and Expressiveness:**\nThe way you convey your personal experiences and the benefits of computers shows a genuine emotional journey, which is exactly what I encourage in this class. Your expressive language and varied sentence structures contribute to the emotional appeal of your writing. For instance, phrases like \"a convenient way to do this was by using a computer\" and describing how computers help people stay connected, add richness to your narrative.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n- **Transitions:** While your ideas are well-organized, some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the overall flow. For example, moving from communication benefits to educational uses of computers could be more seamless with a transitional sentence connecting the two ideas.\n- **Varied Vocabulary:** While your word choice is generally effective, there are moments where varied vocabulary could further enhance your writing. Try incorporating more vivid and precise words to replace common or repetitive phrases.\n- **Conventions:** There are a few minor issues with spelling and capitalization. For instance, \"infromation\" should be \"information,\" and \"coordiantion\" should be \"coordination.\" Ensuring these small errors are corrected will improve the readability and professionalism of your essay.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nYou conclude effectively by summarizing the main points and reiterating the benefits of computers. However, consider adding a more compelling call to action to leave a lasting impact on the reader. Maybe suggest specific ways readers can leverage computers for their own benefit, or emphasize the importance of staying informed and connected in today\u2019s digital age.\n\nOverall, you've made a strong case for the positive effects of computers, supported by personal anecdotes and clear, organized arguments. Your essay is emotionally resonant and engaging, and with a few refinements, it will be even more impactful. Keep",

        "textSelection": "I believe the current way materials are censored and removed works, and should continue. While everyone @MONTH1 dislike a particular novel or book, libraries can not remove every book a person dislikes, as Katherine Paterson said. When a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it, then the book usually is taken off of the shelves.     The possibility children will see the offensve material appears unlikely. Most public libraries do not put their offensive material near the childrens books. At my local library, their is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place. To acquire these books you must have a parents permission or be @NUM1 years of age. It is very unlikely a child would ever see the materials in question.     Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated. @PERSON3 @PERSON2 @MONTH1 have had racial slurs in it, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were normal for the time. Someone can not be frustrated with a novel written @NUM2 years ago because it has something offensive in it by todays standards.     While I believe, for the most part, libraries should not censor or remove materials, there should be some restrictions set in place to keep extremely harmful materials out of libraries. For instance, libraries should not have dirty magazines or movies on their shelves. If a high majority of people want a particular material banned, then it is hard to ignore them. When a book is so vulgar people begin to protest the book, there are questions as to whether the book should remain on library shelves. When a high percentage of people join that cause, then it should be banned.     Censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today. I believe the current system in place to censor or remove books does its job, and that it should continue. If few people disapprove of a particular material, the book remains in most shelves uncensored. When a lot of people begin to protest that same material, it has a high probability of being banned. With this process, every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not removed, while the ones that truly deserve it are removed.",

While everyone @MONTH1 dislike a particular novel or book, libraries can not remove every book a person dislikes, as Katherine Paterson said. When a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it, then the book usually is taken off of the shelves.     The possibility children will see the offensve material appears unlikely. Most public libraries do not put their offensive material near the childrens books. At my local library, their is a section that has the more offensive or obscene books all in one place. To acquire these books you must have a parents permission or be @NUM1 years of age. It is very unlikely a child would ever see the materials in question.     Numerous people who find the materials offensive must also remember the time and place the story originated. @PERSON3 @PERSON2 @MONTH1 have had racial slurs in it, but if one considers the time and place of the novel, these slurs were normal for the time. Someone can not be frustrated with a novel written @NUM2 years ago because it has something offensive in it by todays standards.     While I believe, for the most part, libraries should not censor or remove materials, there should be some restrictions set in place to keep extremely harmful materials out of libraries. For instance, libraries should not have dirty magazines or movies on their shelves. If a high majority of people want a particular material banned, then it is hard to ignore them. When a book is so vulgar people begin to protest the book, there are questions as to whether the book should remain on library shelves. When a high percentage of people join that cause, then it should be banned.     Censoring or removing materials from libraries remains a hot topic today. I believe the current system in place to censor or remove books does its job, and that it should continue. If few people disapprove of a particular material, the book remains in most shelves uncensored. When a lot of people begin to protest that same material, it has a high probability of being banned. With this process, every book with a racial slur or questionable scene is not removed, while the ones that truly deserve it are removed.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Your essay on library censorship reflects a thoughtful and balanced perspective, addressing a complex issue with maturity and insight. Your thesis is clear and well-articulated, effectively summarizing your stance on the current system of library censorship.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Clarity and Focus:** Your argument is focused and coherent, maintaining a clear line of reasoning throughout. You successfully convey that while some degree of censorship may be necessary, the current system generally functions well to address the concerns of the majority.\n2. **Personal Anecdotes and Observations:** The inclusion of your experience with your local library adds a personal touch and an element of authenticity to your argument. This not only supports your thesis but also helps readers relate to your point of view.\n3. **Balanced Discussion:** You do a commendable job of presenting both sides of the argument, acknowledging the necessity of some restrictions while advocating for the overall preservation of controversial materials. This balanced approach enhances the credibility of your essay.\n4. **Appropriate Vocabulary:** Your word choice is varied and appropriate, contributing to the clarity and impact of your writing. Phrases like \"extremely harmful materials\" and \"highly unlikely\" are effective in conveying the severity and likelihood of the scenarios you discuss.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n1. **Emotional Impact:** While your argument is clear, it could benefit from more emotive language and vivid examples to engage readers on a deeper emotional level. Consider incorporating more personal anecdotes or hypothetical scenarios that evoke strong emotional responses.\n2. **Sentence Fluency:** Some sentences are a bit lengthy and could be broken down for better readability. For instance, \"While everyone @MONTH1 dislike a particular novel or book, libraries can not remove every book a person dislikes, as Katherine Paterson said.\" could be more fluidly expressed as two sentences to maintain a smooth reading experience.\n3. **Transitions and Flow:** Although your essay is well-organized, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother. Using transitional phrases can help maintain the flow of ideas and make the essay more cohesive.\n4. **Conventions:** Pay attention to minor grammatical errors and typos, such as \"their\" instead of \"there\" and \"offensve\" instead of \"offensive.\" These small mistakes can detract from the overall professionalism of your writing.\n\n**Specific Suggestions:**\n- Consider rephrasing the sentence \"When a book appears so controversial to the point where the majority of people disapprove of it, then the book usually is taken off of the shelves.\" to \"When a book becomes so controversial that the majority of people disapprove of it, it is usually removed from the shelves.\" This small change enhances clarity and fluency.\n- Add more emotive language to your conclusion to leave a lasting impact on the reader. For example, \"With this process, we strike a balance between preserving freedom of expression and protecting our community from harmful content.\"\n\nOverall, your essay demonstrates a well-reasoned argument with a clear structure",

This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer\u0092s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, \u0093wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke\u0094 (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the setting and its effect on the cyclist but lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The inclusion of specific examples, such as the intense heat and dehydration the cyclist experienced, provides some support to the points made. However, the response often strays from a clear focus on the emotional and physical impact of the setting on the cyclist. The language used is somewhat repetitive and lacks variety, making the reading experience less engaging. Additionally, there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as \"desented\" instead of \"deserted\" and \"sorroundings\" instead of \"surroundings,\" which detract from the overall readability. While the narrative does include some transitional phrases, the flow is disjointed, and the essay fails to maintain a strong emotional connection with the reader. Further development of the central idea and emotional resonance would improve the essay significantly.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead.

The narrator tried the test once and failed. She bought herself a flower to cheer herself up. Her mother talked to her and then she felt better. She felt determined to pass the driving test just like the flower was determined to survive.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic recounting of the narrator's journey with the driving test and includes some emotional elements, such as the narrator's initial failure and their interaction with their mother. However, it falls short in terms of depth and emotional resonance. The essay lacks specific personal anecdotes and vivid emotional appeals that would make the narrative more engaging and impactful. The connection between the flower and the narrator's determination is not fully fleshed out, leaving the reader wanting more insight into the narrator's feelings and motivations. Additionally, the structure of the essay is quite simplistic, with a series of events listed without much coherence or fluid transitions, which detracts from the overall flow. The language used is basic and does not capture the emotional intensity or expressiveness expected in a high-scoring essay. While there are minimal grammatical errors, the vocabulary is limited and repetitive, which affects the overall readability and engagement. To improve, the essay should include more detailed personal stories, stronger emotional appeals, and varied, expressive language to create a more compelling narrative.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

I chuckled, checked my water \nsupply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool \npines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. \nTwenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, \nand a corral that couldn\u2019t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had \nbeen hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of \nCalifornia in June. \nI got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my \nstrength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the \nneighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water \nwouldn\u2019t cool down. It didn\u2019t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. \nThe old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make \nthat! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so\u2014a test of my inner spirit. \nNot two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was \nreplaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign \njumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. \nThe speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so \ncruel. \nI toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake\u2014it \nreally did look like a diamondback\u2014blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased \npast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. \nThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my \nshirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June \nsimply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn\u2019t been off their porch in decades, \ncaused me to laugh. \nIt was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. \nThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride \ndown into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I\u2019d \nbe fine. \nOver one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make \nsure it wasn\u2019t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst \nof energy, I maneuvered down the hill. \nIn an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building\u2014abandoned years \nearlier, by the looks of it\u2014had been a Welch\u2019s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A \nsandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still \nbe seen. \nI hung my head. \nThat smoky blues tune \u201cSummertime\u201d rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating \nbrain. \nI got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. \nI\u2019d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you \nhave left to circulate. With any luck I\u2019d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. \nIt didn\u2019t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some \nexpensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and \ntheir keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I \nwas going to lose consciousness for the last time. \nSomehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining \nelevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear \nwere all behind me. \nGARY AND WILBER\u2019S FISH CAMP\u2014IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE\u2019RE \nYOUR BEST BET! \n\u201cAnd the only bet,\u201d I remember thinking. \nAs I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an \noverwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait\u2014any bait, even \nthough I didn\u2019t own a rod or reel. \nAn old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay touches on some of the critical features of the setting in Joe Kurmaskie's \"Rough Road Ahead,\" such as the harsh desert environment and the abandoned ghost town. These elements indeed play an essential role in shaping the cyclist's experience and emotions. However, there are several areas where your writing can improve to create a more emotionally engaging and clear narrative.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement Clarity and Emotional Impact**: Your thesis statement, \"the feature of the setting affected the cyclist,\" is quite broad. Try to craft a more specific and emotionally impactful thesis. For example, \"The unforgiving desert and ghostly remnants of civilization in Joe Kurmaskie's 'Rough Road Ahead' evoke a profound sense of desperation and resilience in the cyclist.\"\n\n2. **Structural Organization and Flow**: The essay would benefit from a clearer structure. Consider organizing your thoughts into distinct paragraphs, each focusing on a specific aspect of the setting and its emotional impact on the cyclist. For instance, one paragraph could discuss the desert's heat and its physical toll, while another could explore the psychological effects of encountering the ghost town.\n\n3. **Personal Anecdotes and Emotional Resonance**: To deepen the emotional connection, try to incorporate more vivid descriptions and personal reflections. For example, describe how the cyclist's dwindling hope mirrors his physical exhaustion, or how the tar-like substance from the pump symbolizes the crushing disappointment.\n\n4. **Expressive Vocabulary and Varied Sentence Structures**: Your language tends to be repetitive and could benefit from more varied and expressive vocabulary. Instead of saying \"his hope was dwindling,\" you might say \"his hope was evaporating under the relentless desert sun.\" Utilize varied sentence structures to maintain the reader's interest and enhance the emotional journey.\n\n5. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are several grammatical errors that detract from the overall readability. For example, \"he water supply was emicated\" should be \"his water supply was depleted.\" Make sure to proofread your work to correct such errors.\n\n6. **Engaging Conclusion**: Your conclusion feels abrupt. Reflect on the broader emotional journey of the cyclist, perhaps tying it back to a personal experience or greater lesson about resilience and the human spirit.\n\nHere's a revised version of your first few sentences to illustrate these points:\n\n\"In Joe Kurmaskie's 'Rough Road Ahead,' the harsh desert landscape and the eerie, empty ghost town profoundly impact the cyclist's physical and emotional state. Battling the searing heat of the Californian desert in June, he finds his water supply depleting rapidly, intensifying his sense of desperation. The discovery of a water pump that produces only tar-like sludge further crushes his spirits, making him question his survival and trust in others.\"\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, you'll create a more compelling and emotionally resonant essay that aligns with the goals of fostering a deep emotional connection and expressive storytelling.\n\nI look forward to seeing how you further develop and refine your essay.

This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer\u0092s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, \u0093wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke\u0094 (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the setting and its effect on the cyclist but lacks depth and clarity in its analysis. The inclusion of specific examples, such as the intense heat and dehydration the cyclist experienced, provides some support to the points made. However, the response often strays from a clear focus on the emotional and physical impact of the setting on the cyclist. The language used is somewhat repetitive and lacks variety, making the reading experience less engaging. Additionally, there are noticeable grammatical errors, such as \"desented\" instead of \"deserted\" and \"sorroundings\" instead of \"surroundings,\" which detract from the overall readability. While the narrative does include some transitional phrases, the flow is disjointed, and the essay fails to maintain a strong emotional connection with the reader. Further development of the central idea and emotional resonance would improve the essay significantly.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay provides a good starting point in addressing how the setting affects the cyclist, but it needs more development to fully capture the emotional and physical impact of the environment. Let's delve deeper into your points:\n\n1. **Emotional Connection and Descriptive Language:**\n   You mention that the cyclist was riding in the desert and that the towns were abandoned, but this could be expanded to create a more vivid picture. Consider describing the isolation and desolation the cyclist felt, perhaps by incorporating more evocative language and sensory details. For example, you might describe the eerie silence of the ghost towns and the oppressive heat that felt like it was suffocating the cyclist.\n\n2. **Use of Personal Anecdotes and Specific Examples:**\n   Including more specific examples from the text can help support your points. Instead of just stating that the month was June and the sun was beating down on him, you could mention how the cyclist noticed the \"wide rings of dried sweat\" on his shirt and how he could \"drop from heatstroke.\" These details help the reader feel the cyclist's struggle and desperation.\n\n3. **Emotional Impact and Thesis Statement Clarity:**\n   Your thesis statement could be more emotionally impactful. Rather than simply stating the setting affected the cyclist, consider framing it in a way that highlights the emotional and physical toll on him. For example, \"The harsh desert setting, with its unrelenting heat and desolate towns, pushed the cyclist to the brink of exhaustion and despair.\"\n\n4. **Flow and Coherence:**\n   To improve the flow of your essay, work on creating smoother transitions between sentences and ideas. Currently, the points feel a bit disjointed. For instance, you could connect the ideas by saying, \"As the sun beat down mercilessly, the cyclist pushed on through abandoned towns, his water supply dwindling with each passing mile.\"\n\n5. **Expressive Language and Sentence Structures:**\n   Try to incorporate more varied and expressive vocabulary to enhance the emotional resonance of your writing. Instead of saying \"he was cycling with very little water,\" you might say, \"he pedaled through the scorching desert, the few precious sips of water he had left barely enough to keep him going.\"\n\nOverall, your essay shows potential, but with more detailed examples, emotional depth, and varied language, it can truly resonate with the reader. Keep working on developing your points and connecting more deeply with the emotional journey of the cyclist. You're on the right track\u2014let's keep pushing to make your writing as compelling and impactful as it can be!",

        "llmResponse": "Your essay addresses the topic of censorship in libraries and makes a strong argument that books, movies, magazines, and other materials should not be removed simply due to someone's negative opinion. Your main idea is clear, which is commendable. However, there are several areas where your essay could be enhanced to make your argument more compelling and your writing more polished.\n\nFirstly, your thesis statement is strong, but it could be more precise. Instead of posing questions, try stating your stance more assertively. For example, \"Materials should not be removed from library shelves simply because some people find them offensive.\"\n\nThe organization of your essay can be improved for better clarity and logical flow. Currently, the transition between your points is somewhat abrupt. Consider using transitional phrases to guide the reader smoothly from one idea to the next. For instance, after quoting Katherine Paterson, you might add, \"This highlights the importance of preserving a diverse collection of books in public libraries.\"\n\nYour use of vocabulary is generally appropriate, but there are a few imprecise or informal words. For example, \"bookselfs\" should be \"bookshelves,\" and \"corious\" should be \"curious.\" Additionally, the word \"arthur\" should be corrected to \"author.\" Ensuring that your vocabulary is varied and accurate will help to articulate your arguments more convincingly.\n\nIn terms of sentence fluency, aim for more varied sentence structures to maintain the reader\u2019s interest. For example, instead of repeating \"I would\" in successive sentences, you can combine them for a smoother read: \"They either tell me it is a good novel or horrible, but after reading a few pages, I often find it quite engaging.\"\n\nGrammatically, there are several errors that need attention. For instance, \"self\" should be \"shelf,\" and \"varity\" should be \"variety.\" Also, ensure that you use correct punctuation and capitalization, such as \"Considering that\" instead of \"considering that.\"\n\nYour conclusion could be more effective in summarizing your main points and reinforcing your thesis. For example, \"In conclusion, allowing individual preferences to dictate library collections would severely limit the diversity of materials available to the public. It is crucial to maintain a variety of perspectives and topics in our libraries to encourage open-mindedness and intellectual growth.\"\n\nOverall, your essay has a strong foundation, but with improved organization, refined vocabulary, varied sentence structures, and attention to grammatical accuracy, it can be even more persuasive and impactful. Keep these points in mind, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you encounter difficulties. Your effort to clearly communicate your ideas is evident, and with continued practice, your writing will become even more confident and precise.",

That's like saying they should have taken @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 when it first came out off the market because it has violance in it ,profange language,and guns that company will had lost a lot of money because it is inapprotive for kids.I think that parent's shouldn't go buy a @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old something like that but some parents do .It not the creaters fault of the actions of how people react to what ever is put out there because the buyers have to be more responseable and make sure that what ever it is is supervised and carefully montoired. There's an old saying ' every thing isn't made for every body' .I strongly belive that;That saying is so true .Every body don't like the same thing that some one eles likes but its okay for that person but it's not okay for you because as they say everything isn't for every body and you can't fource nothing on some one.Well every thing isn't approtive  for every one we all have are limites to every thing and if you watch what kids watch and do than things want be so inapprotive for this wold . Certion books young children should not read because they have sex in them and they talk about things that a child should not even be thinking about at that age.When children read books like that they tend to think about sex and how what they read about will feel but children should not be thinking about that type of stuff that why its there parent's responseabitly to montoir what there children read because that there job as parent's to do not the person who wrote the book because they @MONTH1 think there writing to a much older group that can relate to what there talking about but then again there just speacking there mind and infourceing there freedom of speach right one of the rights that we as a people together have been fighting for .I also feel that music help's us to express are selfs so if someone feels that the music is inapprotive for there child then they need to watch what there child is listen to.Music brings out the different moods in every body.All magazines are not for every one because as we all know there are adult magazines the produce certion imagary that children should not see but you can not blame the creater only the buyer is in fault for leaving it in the wrong place after there done with it .There just people trying to make money  off things that they know that people like.",

I know I sure wouldn't.     Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society. It can be found nearly anywhere. In books, magazines, @CAPS1 shows, movies, on the @CAPS2, you name it. All of these are easily accessible by children of all ages. That is why there should be censorship of certain materials, to a certain degree. By this, I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library, it should only be able to be\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay provides a compelling argument for the necessity of censorship to protect children from inappropriate content. The thesis is clear and grammatically correct, establishing a strong foundation for your viewpoint. The development of your argument is consistent, using grammatically precise sentences to emphasize the dangers of exposing young children to explicit material. The conclusion effectively reinforces the thesis, summarizing the key points made throughout the essay. The organization of the essay is commendable, with each paragraph logically flowing into the next, guided by clear and grammatically correct transitions and topic sentences. Your word choice is varied and appropriate, enhancing the persuasiveness of your argument. The complexity and correctness of your sentence structures further contribute to the overall readability and impact of the essay. Additionally, the essay demonstrates strong control of standard writing conventions, with minimal errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Overall, your writing is clear, focused, and engaging, adhering to grammatical conventions and displaying a logical and effective organization.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Have you ever watched or seen a book or even a movie that you do not think kids should be reading or watching? I have, heard of many books. There are even music out there that only adults should be listening too. There are some parents that are strick on what their kids watch, hear, read or sing.

However, it suffers from several issues that impact its overall effectiveness. The clarity of the thesis could be improved, as it feels somewhat scattered and not grammatically polished. The arguments in support of the main idea are present but are overly simplistic and repetitive, lacking the depth and precise language needed to fully engage the reader. Additionally, the organization of the essay is quite weak, with paragraphs that do not follow a clear, logical structure and transitions that are often awkward or missing altogether. The word choice and sentence structures are basic and exhibit numerous grammatical errors, including spelling mistakes (\"childern,\" \"apporaite,\" \"differnet\") and incorrect usage of words. These issues detract from the readability and overall impact of the essay. Furthermore, the conclusion, while summarizing the main points, does not effectively synthesize the arguments to leave a lasting impression. Overall, while the essay's intent is clear, it requires significant refinement in clarity, grammatical accuracy, organization, and language use to meet the stated prioritization of grammatical precision and effective communication.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: kind of stuff.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay presents an earnest perspective on the importance of freedom of speech and personal responsibility in the context of censorship. However, several areas need significant improvement to align with our goals of clarity, grammatical precision, and effective communication.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis statement needs to be more explicit and grammatically precise. While your viewpoint is clear, the statement itself is convoluted and contains double negatives (\"I do not feel these types of things should not be taken off the shelves\"). Consider rephrasing it to clearly convey your stance.\n\n2. **Grammar and Language Conventions**: There are numerous grammatical errors throughout your essay, including incorrect verb forms, misspelled words, and improper use of capitalization and punctuation. For instance, \"takeing away someone's freedom of speach,\" should be \"taking away someone's freedom of speech.\" Additionally, \"fight\" should be \"fought,\" and \"inapprotive\" should be \"inappropriate.\" Focus on using correct spelling, punctuation, and capitalization consistently.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Fluency**: Your sentences often run on and lack clarity. For example, \"It not the creaters fault of the actions of how people react to what ever is put out there because the buyers have to be more responseable and make sure that what ever it is is supervised and carefully montoired.\" This sentence is overly long and confusing. Break it into smaller, more manageable sentences and ensure each sentence clearly conveys a single idea.\n\n4. **Organization**: Your essay lacks a clear and logical structure. Each paragraph should address a single point that supports your thesis, beginning with a topic sentence and followed by supporting details. Currently, your ideas are scattered and lack coherence, making it difficult for the reader to follow your argument.\n\n5. **Word Choice**: Your word choice needs to be more precise and varied. Avoid using slang or colloquial language that may detract from the formal tone of your essay. Words like \"inappropriate\" and \"responsible\" should be spelled correctly and used appropriately to convey your message effectively.\n\n6. **Support and Development**: While your essay includes relevant points, they are often overly general and lack depth. Each supporting argument should be well-developed with specific examples or evidence. For instance, you mention that \"certion books young children should not read because they have sex in them,\" but fail to provide a concrete example or further explanation to strengthen your argument.\n\n7. **Conventions**: Pay attention to the standard writing conventions. There are numerous errors in spelling, capitalization, and punctuation that distract from your message. For example, \"freedom of speach\" should be \"freedom of speech,\" and \"belive\" should be \"believe.\"\n\n8. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion should effectively summarize your main points and restate your thesis in a clear, concise manner. It currently lacks a strong ending and does not effectively synthesize the arguments made throughout the essay.\n\nOverall,",

Take the teacher instruction into account, in case they emphasize specifically what they want you to do.\n\n---------------------------\n\n----- TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is a persona of the teacher. Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.\n\n- **High Priority Goal:**\n  - Ensure each student's writing demonstrates a strong command of grammar and language conventions.\n  - Focus on crafting clear and grammatically correct thesis statements.\n  - Develop well-supported arguments with precise sentences.\n  - Conclude essays effectively.\n  - Create essays with clear and logically structured paragraphs.\n  - Utilize varied and accurate vocabulary.\n  - Maintain grammatical precision, correct spelling, punctuation, and capitalization throughout their work.\n  - Help students communicate their ideas more effectively and confidently.\n\n- **Teaching Style:**\n  - Centered around precision, clarity, and adherence to language conventions.\n  - Provide detailed and constructive feedback focused on grammatical accuracy and clear, logically structured arguments.\n  - Highlight specific areas for improvement to help students understand their mistakes and make meaningful progress.\n  - Emphasize the importance of clear communication and encourage students to ask questions when encountering difficulties.\n  - Feedback is thorough and aimed at refining students' writing skills, ensuring understanding of grammar, syntax, and proper usage.\n  - Praise correct usage and well-structured arguments to reinforce positive learning experiences.\n  - Methodical and supportive approach, enhancing students' mastery of the English language through consistent and precise feedback.\n  - Clear instructions and maintaining an open channel for questions and discussions.\n\n\n\n----- FEEDBACK -----\nHere are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The setting in \u0093Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,\u0094 affected the cyclist greatly. For starters it says he was \u0093traveling through the high desserts\u0094 which is never a safe thing. He had been drinking he water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was, \u0093trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state.\u0094 From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into \u0093A far like substance\u0094 The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay on the influence of the setting in \"Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit\" struggles significantly with clarity, coherence, and adherence to grammatical conventions. The thesis statement is vague and not clearly defined. The essay attempts to discuss how the setting affects the cyclist but lacks specific examples and detailed support from the text, resulting in a superficial response. Many sentences are grammatically incorrect or fragmented, which makes the narrative disjointed and difficult to follow. The organization is weak, with an unclear structure that lacks smooth transitions between ideas. There are numerous spelling and punctuation errors, which further impede readability. Overall, the essay fails to effectively communicate its points due to insufficient content development and weak language control. There is a need for a more structured approach, including a clear thesis, well-supported arguments, and a focus on grammatical accuracy to enhance the overall quality of the writing.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The features of the setting in the essay \u0093Do not exceed the posted speed limit\u0094 affected the cyclist in a negative way. The more and more he rode, he thought more negatively and had alot of doubt. The cyclist was not very confident, he thought he wouldn\u0092t make it. For example, when the cyclist notices nothing in sight, his tone changes. \u0093There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon telling\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic understanding of how the features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist, but it lacks depth and specificity in its analysis. The thesis is not entirely clear and could benefit from a more precise statement. The development of arguments includes some examples from the memoir, but these are not thoroughly analyzed or integrated into a cohesive argument. The writing demonstrates frequent grammatical errors, such as \"alot of doubt\" instead of \"a lot of doubt,\" and issues with sentence structure that impede readability. The organization shows potential but needs clearer, more grammatically correct transitions and topic sentences to enhance the logical flow. The language used is somewhat repetitive and lacks variety, which diminishes the overall impact. While the narrative does employ some transitional phrases, it could be more polished to ensure smoother transitions and a more engaging narrative. Overall, the essay could greatly benefit from a more focused thesis, detailed support from the text, and meticulous proofreading to address grammatical inaccuracies.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The features of the setting affect the cyclist because his body has a hard time adjusting to his life threating situation. The neat and desert atmosphere are draining his body of water, @CAPS1 he needs to keep pedaling on. Also, the terrain is stripped of water, so he doesn't have anything to refuel with.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to address the prompt by discussing how the setting affects the cyclist, but it falls short in several areas. The thesis statement is present but not clearly articulated, and the sentences contain numerous grammatical errors that detract from the overall clarity and readability. The development and support of arguments are weak, with limited evidence from the memoir to substantiate the points made. Additionally, the conclusion is abrupt and does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis. Organization is lacking as the essay jumps from one point to another without clear transitions or topic sentences, making it difficult to follow the narrative. The language and style are also problematic, with a limited vocabulary and repetitive sentence structures that do not enhance the essay's persuasiveness. There are significant errors in spelling, punctuation, and capitalization that further impede readability. Overall, the essay needs substantial improvement in grammatical precision, organization, and the use of supporting evidence to effectively communicate its message.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 3 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit \nby Joe Kurmaskie \nFORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece \nof advice for the solo cyclist would be, \u201cNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers \nwho haven\u2019t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.\u201d It\u2019s not that a group of \nold guys doesn\u2019t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid \nplace. Things change. \nAt a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer \nevening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn\u2019t have done was \nlet them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice \nand launched out at first light along a \u201cshortcut\u201d that was to slice away hours from my ride to \nYosemite National Park. \nThey\u2019d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I \nwould come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with \nstrong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first \u201ctown.\u201d \nThis place might have been a thriving little spot at one time\u2014say, before the last world war\u2014but \non that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water \nsupply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool \npines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. \nTwenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, \nand a corral that couldn\u2019t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had \nbeen hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of \nCalifornia in June. \nI got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my \nstrength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the \nneighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water \nwouldn\u2019t cool down. It didn\u2019t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. \nThe old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make \nthat! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so\u2014a test of my inner spirit. \nNot two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was \nreplaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign \njumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. \nThe speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so \ncruel. \nI toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake\u2014it \nreally did look like a diamondback\u2014blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased \npast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. \nThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my \nshirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June \nsimply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn\u2019t been off their porch in decades, \ncaused me to laugh. \nIt was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. \nThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride \ndown into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I\u2019d \nbe fine. \nOver one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make \nsure it wasn\u2019t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst \nof energy, I maneuvered down the hill. \nIn an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building\u2014abandoned years \nearlier, by the looks of it\u2014had been a Welch\u2019s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A \nsandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still \nbe seen. \nI hung my head. \nThat smoky blues tune \u201cSummertime\u201d rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating \nbrain. \nI got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. \nI\u2019d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you \nhave left to circulate. With any luck I\u2019d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. \nIt didn\u2019t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some \nexpensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and \ntheir keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I \nwas going to lose consciousness for the last time. \nSomehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining \nelevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear \nwere all behind me. \nGARY AND WILBER\u2019S FISH CAMP\u2014IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE\u2019RE \nYOUR BEST BET! \n\u201cAnd the only bet,\u201d I remember thinking. \nAs I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an \noverwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait\u2014any bait, even \nthough I didn\u2019t own a rod or reel. \nAn old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from \nmy head as I slumped against the wall beside him. \n\u201cWhere you headed in such a hurry?\u201d \n\u201cYosemite,\u201d I whispered. \n\u201cKnow the best way to get there?\u201d \nI watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group \nI\u2019d listened to in Lodi. \n\u201cYes, sir! I own a very good map.\u201d \nAnd I promised myself right then that I\u2019d always stick to it in the future. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-3-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 3 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nWrite a response that explains how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.

        "llmResponse": "Thank you for your effort in analyzing how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in \"Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.\" Your essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the prompt, but there are several areas where you can improve to make your writing clearer and more engaging.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement:** Your thesis statement is present but somewhat vague. It would benefit from a clearer and more precise articulation. Instead of saying \"because it goes to many different terrains,\" you could specify how these terrains impact the cyclist's journey and well-being.\n\n   **Example:** \"The diverse and harsh terrains encountered by the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit' significantly strain his physical endurance and mental resolve, ultimately threatening his survival.\"\n\n2. **Content Development:** While you include some examples from the text, your essay would be stronger with more detailed analysis and integration of these examples. Instead of summarizing events, focus on explaining how specific features of the setting create obstacles for the cyclist.\n\n   **Example:** \"The cyclist starts his journey optimistically, but the abandoned towns he encounters symbolize isolation and desolation, compounding his growing sense of hopelessness. For instance, the ghost town he first arrives at underscores his vulnerability, foreshadowing the challenges ahead.\"\n\n3. **Grammar and Language:** There are several grammatical errors that need attention. Phrases like \"his working his way\" should be corrected to \"he is working his way.\" Additionally, ensure the correct spelling of words such as \"different\" and proper punctuation throughout the essay.\n\n4. **Sentence Structure and Vocabulary:** Aim to vary your sentence structure to avoid repetitiveness and enhance readability. Incorporate a wider range of vocabulary to make your narrative more engaging.\n\n   **Example:** \"As he progresses, the cyclist encounters not only rolling hills and tumbleweeds but also an aggressive snake, all of which further deplete his energy and resources.\"\n\n5. **Transitions and Organization:** Your essay would benefit from clearer transitions between points to improve the logical flow. Each paragraph should start with a topic sentence that previews the main idea and help guide the reader through your argument.\n\n   **Example:** \"Moreover, the intense heat and lack of water become critical threats to the cyclist\u2019s survival. Despite the old men\u2019s assurances, the unforgiving environment proves almost fatal.\"\n\n6. **Conclusion:** Your conclusion should effectively summarize the main points and restate how the setting impacts the cyclist. It should tie back to your thesis, reinforcing your argument.\n\n   **Example:** \"In conclusion, the treacherous terrains and extreme conditions the cyclist faces in 'Rough Road Ahead' not only test his physical limits but also his mental resilience, highlighting the profound impact of setting on his harrowing journey.\"\n\nBy focusing on these areas, you can enhance the clarity, coherence, and overall quality of your essay. Keep up the good work, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you need further clarification or assistance",

The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it\u0092s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she\u0092ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus \u0093comes back to life\u0092\u0092. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good she\u0092ll feel good\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic attempt to engage with the prompt, but it lacks clarity and depth. The thesis is not clearly stated, making it difficult for readers to understand the main argument. The development of ideas is minimal and somewhat confusing. For example, instead of explaining why the author concluded the story with a statement about a new beginning, the essay drifts into discussing various unrelated aspects. Grammatical errors such as \"about,\" \"is,\" \"desrves,\" and inconsistent verb tenses detract significantly from the readability and flow of the essay. Additionally, the sentence structures are not varied, and the vocabulary is simple and often used incorrectly, leading to a monotonous tone. The paragraph lacks proper transitions, making it disjointed and hard to follow. There is also a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points made, which weakens the overall argument. For future improvement, the writer should focus on crafting a clear thesis, using varied and precise language, and providing specific examples to support their arguments, all while maintaining grammatical accuracy.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succed, one must keep trying. Saeng will adapt to her new copiuntry in time but not if she spends heer time wishing to go back to her homeland. The hibiscus is a reminder to hers of starting a new and adapting to society. Saeng will retry her driver\u0092s test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided lacks clarity and is fraught with grammatical errors, which significantly impede its readability and effectiveness. The thesis statement is somewhat unclear, and the supporting sentences contain numerous mistakes, reducing the impact of the arguments presented. Consequently, the essay does not adequately address the prompt, nor does it remain focused on any coherent argument about Saeng's adaptation to her new country. The sentences are often incomplete or awkwardly structured, further detracting from the essay's overall readability. Additionally, the essay lacks a logical flow, with transitions that are neither smooth nor grammatically correct. The conclusion is abrupt and fails to effectively summarize the thesis, leaving the reader with an incomplete understanding of the author's main points. Improvements in grammatical accuracy, clearer thesis articulation, better organizational structure, and more precise language usage are needed to enhance the quality and coherence of this essay.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus \nby Minfong Ho \nSaeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng\nwalks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist\nshop to see if the plant can be purchased. \nIt was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat\nleaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in\nseemingly random profusion. \n\u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy\npotted plant by the corner. \nThere, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals\nsplayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of\nrecognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \n\u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. \nA saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with\nvermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into\nthe well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the\nbucket. \nSlowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,\noleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had\nnot even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. \nWhen she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and\ncool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. \nAnd beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with\npurplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to\nsee it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick\nwalls or between tiled roofs. \nAnd that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and\nfound a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.\n\u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said,\nsavoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its\ntag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d \nOne of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed\nher eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could\nalmost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she\ncombed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng\nwould help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. \nSaeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm\naround it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed\ncomb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? \nA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a\nchannel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. \nAnd in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. \nIt was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the\nlast remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.\nAs if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of\nthe onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to\nher. \nHer smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully.\n\u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed\nthe potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. \nMrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere\ndid you get it?\u201d \n\u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \n\u201cHow much?\u201d \nFor answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the \nLambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \n\u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \n\u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \n\u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this\nvegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed\nthe tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \n\u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. \nFor a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the\neye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. \nHer mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful\nplant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \n\u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the\nwords at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t\nas pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.\nThat\u2019s what matters.\u201d \nShe tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her\nother hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d \nShe went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The\nsoil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair\ntrailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There\nwas a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \n\u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. \nMrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and\nstart dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. \nLeft alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it.\nShe could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,\nthe sizzle of hot oil in the pan.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay provides a thoughtful attempt to engage with the prompt, but there are several key areas that need improvement to enhance clarity and effectiveness.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis, centered around Saeng's determination to take the test again, is a good start but lacks grammatical precision and coherence. Consider revising it to be clearer and more direct. For example: \"The author concludes with this paragraph to highlight Saeng's determination to overcome failure and her connection to her heritage through the hibiscus.\"\n\n2. **Supporting Arguments**: While you do mention that Saeng is determined to retake the test and that the hibiscus symbolizes her grandmother's presence, these points need more detailed elaboration and stronger textual evidence. Explain how the hibiscus and her grandmother's memory specifically give Saeng the strength and encouragement to try again.\n\n3. **Grammatical Precision**: There are several grammatical errors that detract from the readability of your essay. For instance, \"the auther put this paragraph\" should be \"the author included this paragraph.\" Additionally, \"if the flower budds\" should be corrected to \"if the flower buds.\" Pay close attention to spelling, punctuation, and capitalization to ensure grammatical accuracy throughout your essay.\n\n4. **Sentence Structure and Flow**: Your sentences would benefit from more variety and precision. For example, instead of \"Her grandmother's resemblance is in the flower so if the flower budds, then her grandmother will be back in a sense,\" you could say, \"The hibiscus flower symbolizes her grandmother\u2019s presence, and its budding signifies a renewal of strength and encouragement for Saeng.\"\n\n5. **Transitions and Paragraph Structure**: Improve the organization of your essay by ensuring smooth transitions between ideas. This will help create a more cohesive and logically structured argument. Each paragraph should flow naturally into the next, supporting the overall thesis.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Your conclusion should effectively summarize the main points and tie back to the thesis. Currently, it ends abruptly without reinforcing the key arguments you\u2019ve made. Consider summarizing how Saeng\u2019s determination and the symbolic meaning of the hibiscus contribute to the story\u2019s theme of perseverance and adaptation.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, you can enhance the clarity, coherence, and grammatical precision of your essay, making your argument more compelling and easier to understand. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you encounter any difficulties. Your effort and dedication will surely lead to improvement.\n\n**Revised Example**:\n\"In 'Winter Hibiscus,' the author concludes with the statement, 'When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.' This paragraph underscores Saeng's resolve to overcome her failure and adapt to her new life in the United States. The hibiscus flower symbolizes not only her grandmother\u2019s presence but also Saeng's own strength and resilience. As the",

Provide feedback that is aligned with the teacher's style and the class needs. Use all of the information at your disposable to customize to the teacher and class. Take the teacher instruction into account, in case they emphasize specifically what they want you to do.\n\n---------------------------\n\n----- TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is a persona of the teacher. Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.\n\n- **High Priority Goal:**\n  - Ensure each student's writing demonstrates a strong command of grammar and language conventions.\n  - Focus on crafting clear and grammatically correct thesis statements.\n  - Develop well-supported arguments with precise sentences.\n  - Conclude essays effectively.\n  - Create essays with clear and logically structured paragraphs.\n  - Utilize varied and accurate vocabulary.\n  - Maintain grammatical precision, correct spelling, punctuation, and capitalization throughout their work.\n  - Help students communicate their ideas more effectively and confidently.\n\n- **Teaching Style:**\n  - Centered around precision, clarity, and adherence to language conventions.\n  - Provide detailed and constructive feedback focused on grammatical accuracy and clear, logically structured arguments.\n  - Highlight specific areas for improvement to help students understand their mistakes and make meaningful progress.\n  - Emphasize the importance of clear communication and encourage students to ask questions when encountering difficulties.\n  - Feedback is thorough and aimed at refining students' writing skills, ensuring understanding of grammar, syntax, and proper usage.\n  - Praise correct usage and well-structured arguments to reinforce positive learning experiences.\n  - Methodical and supportive approach, enhancing students' mastery of the English language through consistent and precise feedback.\n  - Clear instructions and maintaining an open channel for questions and discussions.\n\n\n\n----- FEEDBACK -----\nHere are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memoreies of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring. This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The concluding paragraph of the essay presents several issues related to clarity, structure, and content. The overall message is somewhat muddled due to confusing syntax and word choice, which detracts from the intended emphasis on the author's memories of her homeland. The paragraph could benefit from more precise language and a clearer connection between the memories evoked by the spring season and the author's decision to retake her driving test. Additionally, the development of the argument lacks coherence, with details about animals and blossoming trees feeling tangential and underdeveloped. The organization is also weak, as transitions between sentences are abrupt, making the narrative hard to follow. Furthermore, grammatical errors such as \"memoreies,\" \"beautifu,\" and several awkward phrasings, impede readability and distract from the content. To improve, the essay should focus on refining sentence structures, ensuring grammatical accuracy, and creating a more logical flow of ideas to effectively convey the emotional significance of the author's memories.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it\u0092s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she\u0092ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus \u0093comes back to life\u0092\u0092. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good she\u0092ll feel good\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic attempt to engage with the prompt, but it lacks clarity and depth. The thesis is not clearly stated, making it difficult for readers to understand the main argument. The development of ideas is minimal and somewhat confusing. For example, instead of explaining why the author concluded the story with a statement about a new beginning, the essay drifts into discussing various unrelated aspects. Grammatical errors such as \"about,\" \"is,\" \"desrves,\" and inconsistent verb tenses detract significantly from the readability and flow of the essay. Additionally, the sentence structures are not varied, and the vocabulary is simple and often used incorrectly, leading to a monotonous tone. The paragraph lacks proper transitions, making it disjointed and hard to follow. There is also a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points made, which weakens the overall argument. For future improvement, the writer should focus on crafting a clear thesis, using varied and precise language, and providing specific examples to support their arguments, all while maintaining grammatical accuracy.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the story with  \u0093When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again\u0094 For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better. \u0093 A wave of loss so deep and\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a solid effort but struggles with clarity and structure. The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus \nby Minfong Ho \nSaeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng\nwalks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist\nshop to see if the plant can be purchased. \nIt was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat\nleaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in\nseemingly random profusion. \n\u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy\npotted plant by the corner. \nThere, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals\nsplayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of\nrecognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \n\u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. \nA saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with\nvermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into\nthe well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the\nbucket. \nSlowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,\noleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had\nnot even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. \nWhen she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and\ncool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. \nAnd beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with\npurplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to\nsee it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick\nwalls or between tiled roofs. \nAnd that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and\nfound a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.\n\u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said,\nsavoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its\ntag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d \nOne of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it.

The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could\nalmost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she\ncombed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng\nwould help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. \nSaeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay shows an initial attempt to address the prompt; however, it requires significant improvements to meet the expectations for clarity, depth, and grammatical accuracy. Here are some targeted areas for enhancement:\n\n1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis lacks precision and clarity. Instead of simply stating that \"it's a very good ending paragraph,\" aim to articulate why the author chose this conclusion in relation to the broader themes of the story. For example, discuss how the final paragraph reflects Saeng's emotional journey and determination to adapt to her new life.\n\n2. **Development of Ideas**: The arguments presented are underdeveloped. You need to provide specific examples from the text to support your points. Explain how the imagery of spring, the melting snow, and the budding hibiscus symbolize renewal and Saeng's resolve to overcome her challenges.\n\n3. **Grammatical Accuracy**: There are several grammatical issues that need attention. For example, \"its\" should be \"it's,\" and \"determind\" should be \"determined.\" Focusing on these details will enhance the readability and professionalism of your essay.\n\n4. **Sentence Structure and Vocabulary**: Your sentences are quite simple and repetitive, which detracts from the engagement of the reader. Try to use varied sentence structures and a broader range of vocabulary to make your writing more interesting and dynamic.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The conclusion needs to effectively tie back to your thesis and summarize the key points made in your essay. Ensure that it reinforces the significance of the final paragraph in the context of Saeng's personal growth and determination.\n\n### Example Revision:\n\"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to highlight Saeng's resolve and the symbolic significance of spring. The imagery of melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus encapsulates themes of renewal and hope. This final paragraph underscores Saeng's determination to assimilate into her new life in the United States despite the challenges she faces. It is a powerful conclusion that not only captures Saeng's personal growth but also provides a hopeful outlook for her future.\"\n\n### Next Steps:\n- **Revise your thesis** to clearly state the connection between the concluding paragraph and the story's themes.\n- **Expand your arguments** by including specific examples from the text that support your points.\n- **Proofread** for grammatical errors and improve sentence variety and vocabulary.\n\nRemember, precision, clarity, and well-supported arguments are key to effective writing. If you have any questions or need further guidance, please feel free to ask.",

Take the teacher instruction into account, in case they emphasize specifically what they want you to do.\n\n---------------------------\n\n----- TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is a persona of the teacher. Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.\n\n- **High Priority Goal:**\n  - Ensure each student's writing demonstrates a strong command of grammar and language conventions.\n  - Focus on crafting clear and grammatically correct thesis statements.\n  - Develop well-supported arguments with precise sentences.\n  - Conclude essays effectively.\n  - Create essays with clear and logically structured paragraphs.\n  - Utilize varied and accurate vocabulary.\n  - Maintain grammatical precision, correct spelling, punctuation, and capitalization throughout their work.\n  - Help students communicate their ideas more effectively and confidently.\n\n- **Teaching Style:**\n  - Centered around precision, clarity, and adherence to language conventions.\n  - Provide detailed and constructive feedback focused on grammatical accuracy and clear, logically structured arguments.\n  - Highlight specific areas for improvement to help students understand their mistakes and make meaningful progress.\n  - Emphasize the importance of clear communication and encourage students to ask questions when encountering difficulties.\n  - Feedback is thorough and aimed at refining students' writing skills, ensuring understanding of grammar, syntax, and proper usage.\n  - Praise correct usage and well-structured arguments to reinforce positive learning experiences.\n  - Methodical and supportive approach, enhancing students' mastery of the English language through consistent and precise feedback.\n  - Clear instructions and maintaining an open channel for questions and discussions.\n\n\n\n----- FEEDBACK -----\nHere are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it\u0092s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she\u0092ll retake the test.

When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good she\u0092ll feel good\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates a basic attempt to engage with the prompt, but it lacks clarity and depth. The thesis is not clearly stated, making it difficult for readers to understand the main argument. The development of ideas is minimal and somewhat confusing. For example, instead of explaining why the author concluded the story with a statement about a new beginning, the essay drifts into discussing various unrelated aspects. Grammatical errors such as \"about,\" \"is,\" \"desrves,\" and inconsistent verb tenses detract significantly from the readability and flow of the essay. Additionally, the sentence structures are not varied, and the vocabulary is simple and often used incorrectly, leading to a monotonous tone. The paragraph lacks proper transitions, making it disjointed and hard to follow. There is also a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points made, which weakens the overall argument. For future improvement, the writer should focus on crafting a clear thesis, using varied and precise language, and providing specific examples to support their arguments, all while maintaining grammatical accuracy.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the story with  \u0093When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again\u0094 For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better. \u0093 A wave of loss so deep and\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a solid effort but struggles with clarity and structure. The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succed, one must keep trying. Saeng will adapt to her new copiuntry in time but not if she spends heer time wishing to go back to her homeland. The hibiscus is a reminder to hers of starting a new and adapting to society. Saeng will retry her driver\u0092s test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided lacks clarity and is fraught with grammatical errors, which significantly impede its readability and effectiveness. The thesis statement is somewhat unclear, and the supporting sentences contain numerous mistakes, reducing the impact of the arguments presented. Consequently, the essay does not adequately address the prompt, nor does it remain focused on any coherent argument about Saeng's adaptation to her new country. The sentences are often incomplete or awkwardly structured, further detracting from the essay's overall readability. Additionally, the essay lacks a logical flow, with transitions that are neither smooth nor grammatically correct. The conclusion is abrupt and fails to effectively summarize the thesis, leaving the reader with an incomplete understanding of the author's main points. Improvements in grammatical accuracy, clearer thesis articulation, better organizational structure, and more precise language usage are needed to enhance the quality and coherence of this essay.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus \nby Minfong Ho \nSaeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng\nwalks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist\nshop to see if the plant can be purchased. \nIt was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat\nleaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in\nseemingly random profusion. \n\u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy\npotted plant by the corner. \nThere, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals\nsplayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of\nrecognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \n\u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. \nA saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with\nvermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into\nthe well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the\nbucket. \nSlowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,\noleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had\nnot even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. \nWhen she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and\ncool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. \nAnd beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with\npurplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to\nsee it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick\nwalls or between tiled roofs. \nAnd that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and\nfound a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.\n\u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said,\nsavoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its\ntag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d \nOne of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed\nher eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could\nalmost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she\ncombed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng\nwould help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. \nSaeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm\naround it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed\ncomb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? \nA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a\nchannel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. \nAnd in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. \nIt was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the\nlast remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.\nAs if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of\nthe onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to\nher. \nHer smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully.\n\u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed\nthe potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. \nMrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere\ndid you get it?\u201d \n\u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \n\u201cHow much?\u201d \nFor answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the \nLambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \n\u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \n\u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \n\u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this\nvegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed\nthe tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \n\u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. \nFor a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the\neye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. \nHer mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful\nplant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \n\u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the\nwords at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t\nas pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.\nThat\u2019s what matters.\u201d \nShe tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her\nother hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d \nShe went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The\nsoil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair\ntrailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There\nwas a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \n\u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. \nMrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and\nstart dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. \nLeft alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it.\nShe could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,\nthe sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth\nwatered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not\neven Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.\nBut she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. \nThe \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.\nOverhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng\nnow. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange\nbefore had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her\nnow. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against\nthe evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. \nWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the\ngeese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-4-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 4 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nRead the last paragraph of the story. \n\"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and\nthe geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.\" \nWrite a response that explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay demonstrates a promising start, but there are several areas that need improvement for better clarity and coherence. Let's break down some of the key points:\n\n1. **Thesis Statement**:\n   - Your thesis statement is somewhat vague and lacks precision. The statement, \"it has a 'touching' affect to the reader and it basically sums up all the paints talked about in the story,\" needs to be clearer and more specific. Instead, consider something like, \"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to evoke a sense of resolution and emotional connection, encapsulating the main themes of hope and perseverance.\"\n\n2. **Supporting Evidence**:\n   - While you attempt to use quotes to support your points, the integration and explanation of these quotes need refinement. For example, you mention, \"Saeng vowed silently to herself,\u201d but you don't fully explain how this quote creates imagery or why it's significant. Elaborate on how this imagery contributes to the story's emotional impact.\n   - Your second example, \"When the geese return hibiscus is budding I will take that test again,\" is relevant but needs deeper analysis. Explain what the geese and hibiscus symbolize and how they relate to Saeng's personal growth and determination.\n\n3. **Language and Grammar**:\n   - There are several grammatical errors and awkward phrases that detract from the essay\u2019s readability. For instance, \"author lend them many different ways\" should be \"authors end their stories in many different ways.\"\n   - Ensure correct use of punctuation and capitalization, such as \"touching effect\" instead of \"touching affect\" and \"points\" instead of \"paints.\"\n   - Work on sentence structure to avoid run-on sentences and make your writing more concise and varied.\n\n4. **Organization and Flow**:\n   - The essay needs better transitions between ideas to improve flow. Use linking words to guide the reader through your argument logically.\n   - Your conclusion should effectively summarize your main points and restate the thesis in a more refined way. Currently, it ends abruptly and doesn't provide a strong closure to your argument.\n\n5. **Prompt Adherence**:\n   - While you address the prompt, the response could benefit from a more focused and thorough analysis. Make sure each point you make directly ties back to explaining why the author chose to conclude the story with that specific paragraph, using detailed evidence from the text.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement**:\n- Spend time revising your thesis statement to make it more specific.\n- Provide deeper analysis and explanation of the quotes you use.\n- Focus on grammatical accuracy and varied sentence structure.\n- Improve transitions for better coherence and flow.\n- Strengthen your conclusion to effectively tie all your points together.\n\nOverall, your essay shows potential, but more effort is needed in clarity, structure, and grammatical precision. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you need further clarification or help with any aspect of your writing. Keep practicing, and you're sure to make significant progress!",

The narrative effectively evokes a warm and comforting mood, supported by specific examples from the memoir. However, there are several grammatical errors and inconsistencies that detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the essay. For instance, the use of \"@CAPS1\" appears to be a placeholder or redaction, which disrupts the flow of the text and makes it difficult to follow. Additionally, there are punctuation issues, such as the use of ampersands (&) instead of \"and,\" and some sentences are overly complex or improperly structured. The organization of the essay is mostly clear, with logical progression from one idea to the next, but some transitions could be smoother.

However, it falls short in several key areas. The thesis statement is somewhat unclear and lacks grammatical accuracy. The arguments are presented, but they lack depth and sufficient development, making the supporting evidence seem superficial. Additionally, the sentences are grammatically correct but often simplistic and repetitive, leading to a lack of complexity and variation in word choice and sentence structure. The organization of the essay is weak, with transitions and topic sentences that do not effectively guide the reader through the argument. Furthermore, there are noticeable errors in spelling and punctuation, which detract from the overall quality of the writing. To improve, the writer should focus on crafting a clear and grammatically correct thesis statement, developing arguments with greater depth and precision, and ensuring that transitions and topic sentences are logically structured and grammatically accurate. Enhanced vocabulary and varied sentence structures would also contribute to a more engaging and effective essay.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author ends the story with  \u0093When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again\u0094 For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better. \u0093 A wave of loss so deep and\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: Your essay presents a solid effort but struggles with clarity and structure. The thesis statement, centered around the idea that Saeng will retake the test for several reasons, lacks grammatical precision and coherence, making it difficult to follow. The supporting arguments, though present, are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration and stronger evidence from the text to bolster the points made. The conclusion attempts to emphasize that the story is not yet over, but it does not effectively summarize or tie back to the thesis, reducing the overall impact. The organization of the essay needs improvement; transitions between paragraphs and ideas are minimal, leading to a fragmented reading experience. Language and word choice are somewhat limited and repetitive, detracting from the engagement of the reader. Additionally, grammatical errors, such as tense inconsistencies and missing punctuation, are present throughout, impacting readability. While the essay addresses the prompt, a more focused and grammatically precise approach is necessary to adequately convey your ideas and achieve a higher level of effectiveness.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 5 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Narciso Rodriguez \nfrom Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives \nMy parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a \nfurnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old \nNarciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon \ncall home. \nIn 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the \nIronbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our \ntraditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared \ncooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking \nthat is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which \nI adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of \nchildhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed \nboth, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. \nGrowing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \u201cfamily\u201d had nothing to do with \nbeing a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, \nCuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation \nprevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these \ncultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of \nhonest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their \nown kind, were clearly in need. \nOur landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and \nAlegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio \nand Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not \nknow my \u201creal\u201d grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were \nallowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and \nRosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family \nmembers came and went \u2014 and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they \nwere able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the \nmany people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. \nMy mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the \nlanguage or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a \nbetter life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country \nthey loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters \nwhile yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were \nstrong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind \nof jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had \nstudied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, \ntaking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their \nchildren to better times drove them to endure these hard times. \nI will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I\u2019ve often told them that what \nthey did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I\u2019ve often told them of \nmy admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I\u2019ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in \nreality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at \nsuch an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two \nlessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these \nteachings have been the basis of my life. \nIt was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to \nthis country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this \nhumble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not \njust scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of \u201cfamily.\u201d \nAnd for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I \nlearned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into \na home. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-5-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 5 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nDescribe the mood created by the author in the memoir.

Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally. Nonetheless, this well-told memoir tells of the contentment and good side of it all. The happiness that was created in a place that Narciso calls home. In the home, he still got to experience Cuban culture including music, traditional cooking and best of all ambiance of family being around. \"Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" This quote kind of lightens up the whole idea of this memoir and how people from all over came together to celebrate the wonderful joys of life even though at times they were frowned upon.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Your essay demonstrates a thoughtful engagement with the memoir and a clear effort to convey the positive aspects of Narciso's experience despite the challenges faced by his family. However, there are several areas that need attention to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your writing.\n\n**Thesis Statement:**\nYour thesis statement is somewhat vague and could be more precise. It is important to clearly state the mood created by the author and how it is conveyed through specific elements of the memoir. Consider revising it to something more direct, such as: \"The memoir 'Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' by Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood of warmth and contentment by celebrating Cuban culture and the strong sense of community within the author's family.\"\n\n**Supporting Evidence:**\nYou have included a relevant quote from the memoir, which is a good start. However, your analysis of the quote could be more detailed and directly tied to your thesis. Explain how the specific elements in the quote (childhood innocence, family gatherings, celebrations) contribute to the overall mood of warmth and contentment. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include more quotes or examples from the text to further support your points.\n\n**Grammar and Language:**\nThere are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that need to be addressed for better clarity and readability:\n- \"Living life in a country or place away can be very difficult from what I've known, heard and seen.\" This sentence is unclear and could be rephrased for better understanding. Consider: \"Living in a foreign country can be very challenging, as I have learned from various accounts.\"\n- \"Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally.\" This sentence is somewhat confusing. Consider revising it to: \"Poverty, along with occasional racism and discrimination, often complicates the situation.\"\n- \"Nonetheless, this well-told memoir tells of the contentment and good side of it all.\" This sentence could be clearer. Consider: \"Nonetheless, the memoir highlights the contentment and positive aspects of life in their new home.\"\n\n**Organization and Structure:**\nYour essay would benefit from a more structured organization. Begin with a clear introduction that includes your revised thesis statement. Follow with body paragraphs that each focus on a specific point or piece of evidence from the memoir, and provide detailed analysis. Conclude with a strong paragraph that summarizes your points and reinforces your thesis.\n\n**Vocabulary and Sentence Variety:**\nYour vocabulary is somewhat limited and repetitive in places. Try to incorporate more varied and precise language to make your writing more engaging. Additionally, varying your sentence structure can help maintain the reader's interest and improve the flow of your essay.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nYour conclusion is currently missing. Make sure to include a concluding paragraph that effectively summarizes your main points and reinforces the mood created by the memoir. This will help tie your essay together and leave a lasting impression on the reader.\n\nOverall, your essay shows promise and a clear understanding of the memoir's themes. By addressing the",

For example the author states that his parents had to \"start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find.\" Back in Cuba, \"Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso mom) had Studied chemical engineering.\" This shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to @LOCATION1. This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved.\" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again.

The reading made me happy for Narciso, but curious on how much his parents had to struggle to give Narciso the best life he could get. For example the author states that his parents had to \"start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find.\" Back in Cuba, \"Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso mom) had Studied chemical engineering.\" This shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to @LOCATION1. This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved.\" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again. The author creates a variety of different moods throught the memoir.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Your essay demonstrates a clear effort to analyze the mood created by the author in the memoir. You have identified several emotions, such as happiness, curiosity, and sadness, and supported your points with examples from the text. However, the essay would benefit greatly from improvements in several key areas to enhance clarity, coherence, and grammatical precision.\n\n1. **Thesis Statement and Structure:** \n   - The thesis statement lacks grammatical precision and clarity. A more focused thesis would help guide your essay and make your argument more compelling. Consider rephrasing it to something more specific like: \"The memoir creates a complex mood that intertwines happiness, curiosity, and sadness, reflecting the immigrant experience of Narciso's parents.\"\n   - Your essay would benefit from a clearer and more logical structure. Each paragraph should begin with a topic sentence that introduces the main idea, followed by supporting details and examples from the text.\n\n2. **Supporting Arguments:**\n   - While you provide examples from the text, your analysis of these examples needs more depth. Explain how each example contributes specifically to the mood you are describing. For instance, rather than just stating that the quote made you wonder why the parents immigrated, delve into how this uncertainty contributes to the curious mood.\n   - Ensure that your evidence directly supports your thesis. Some of your points are somewhat disjointed and could benefit from more detailed elaboration to clearly show the connection between the example and the mood.\n\n3. **Language and Grammar:**\n   - There are several grammatical errors and inconsistencies throughout the essay. For instance, \"Narciso mom\" should be \"Narciso's mom,\" and \"carrers\" should be \"careers\". Additionally, ensure that all names and titles are correctly capitalized.\n   - Avoid using placeholders like \"@LOCATION1\" and \"@MONTH1\". These disrupt the flow and coherence of the essay. Instead, use specific names and details from the text.\n   - Improve your sentence structure to enhance readability. For example, \"For example the author states that his parents had to 'start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find.'\" could be more effectively written as: \"The author illustrates the extent of their sacrifice by stating that his parents had to 'start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find.'\"\n\n4. **Vocabulary:**\n   - While your vocabulary is adequate, it could be more varied and precise. Use synonyms and more descriptive words to enhance your writing and avoid repetition. For example, instead of repeatedly using \"sad,\" consider words like \"melancholic\" or \"heartbreaking\" to convey more specific emotional nuances.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Your conclusion should effectively summarize the main points of your essay and tie them back to your thesis. Currently, it feels abrupt and lacks a sense of closure. Consider summarizing the different moods you discussed and how they collectively contribute to the overall emotional impact of the memoir.\n\nOverall, your essay addresses the prompt and",

For example, when I am always using the computer and when I'm doing research it always gives me the ability to learn about new places and people. Another example is when ever I watch @CAPS2.V on @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says that people learn about learn about faraway places and people on the internet @PERCENT1 of the time. @CAPS1 second reason is it allows people to talk online with other people for example when I am on the computer everyday I visit @CAPS1 facebook it always gives me a chance to talk to @CAPS1 friends and other people online. Another example is when I go on a computer and I search computers.org it says that it lets people @PERCENT2 of the time talk to others online. @CAPS1 @NUM4 reason is it allows students to get information when they're doing a project. For example when I always use the @ORGANIZATION1 computers it allows me to get information for example, about @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 govina that is why I benefit people using computers.

Take the teacher instruction into account, in case they emphasize specifically what they want you to do.\n\n---------------------------\n\n----- TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is a persona of the teacher. Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.\n\n### Teacher Persona:\n\n- **Priority Goal:**\n  - Develop students' abilities to write clearly and practically.\n  - Ensure students can articulate thoughts effectively and support arguments with real-world examples.\n  - Emphasize clear thesis statements, logical organization, practical language, and impeccable grammar.\n  - Equip students with tools to communicate coherently and persuasively in academic, professional, and personal contexts.\n\n- **Teaching Style:**\n  - Grounded in clarity, practicality, and real-world relevance.\n  - Provide clear, concise, and actionable feedback.\n  - Use feedback to identify strengths and areas for improvement with concrete examples and practical suggestions.\n  - Ensure comments are specific and directly tied to criteria for success.\n\n- **Student Interaction:**\n  - Prioritize open communication and approachability.\n  - Encourage students to ask questions and seek clarification.\n  - Create an environment where students feel supported and understood.\n  - View mistakes as valuable learning opportunities.\n  - Foster a constructive and supportive atmosphere to build students' confidence in their writing skills.\n\n- **Feedback Characteristics:**\n  - Clear, concise, and actionable.\n  - Specific and tied to criteria for success.\n  - Designed to help students understand expectations and how to achieve them.\n\n- **Overall Approach:**\n  - Focus on clear communication, practical advice, and supportive interactions.\n  - Guide students toward producing clear, well-organized, and precise essays.\n  - Ensure assignments are relevant to real-world contexts.\n\n\n\n----- FEEDBACK -----\nHere are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear editor, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I believe that computers are a benefit to the world, and people as well. I say this because lots of people can talk to family of friends long distance. Also the computer can teach you lots of thing. Finally it makes you more social. In @CAPS1 strong opinion computers are better for the world. Firstly, many people can talk long distance with family of friends. You have web cam and that allows you to chat and see the person. Also @CAPS2 is another site\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and relevant thesis statement regarding the benefits of computers, and the main ideas are adequately supported with examples. However, the arguments could benefit from more specific real-world examples and pragmatic reasoning to strengthen the claims. The essay is organized with an introduction, body, and conclusion, but the transitions between paragraphs and the overall flow could be improved for a smoother reading experience. The word choice is mostly effective, conveying the intended message clearly, although some phrases lack precision and could be refined for better clarity. The sentence structures are varied but could be more fluid to enhance readability. There are minimal errors in conventions, but attention to correct usage of punctuation, spelling, and capitalization would improve the overall quality. Overall, the essay is clear and focused, but it could be enhanced with better organization, more precise language, and stronger examples to fully meet the teacher's expectations for clarity, practicality, and linguistic precision.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear Newspaper editor I would like to make @CAPS3 about the benifits of owning a computer. For example you can learn many thing you would of never of been able too, you can also go in chat rooms and talk with friends or other people and it can even make teaching esyer too. Computers in many countres are standard and we use then to learn many things but if you bring one to the tribes in @LOCATION1 it will look like a alein object but once they know how to use it it can open there eyes for ever\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay you presented demonstrates a genuine enthusiasm for the topic of the benefits of owning a computer, but it requires significant refinement in several areas to meet higher standards. The content is somewhat clear and addresses the prompt, though the examples provided are often broad and lack depth in real-world relevance. Incorporating more specific, illustrative examples would enhance the argument's effectiveness. The organization of the essay is somewhat disjointed, with ideas jumping from one to another without clear transitions or a logical flow. Improving the structure by using well-defined topic sentences and coherent transitions between paragraphs would help. \n\nIn terms of word choice, the essay frequently uses casual and imprecise language, which detracts from its persuasive power. Employing a more formal and precise vocabulary would improve readability and impact. Sentence fluency is also an issue; many sentences are awkwardly constructed and run-on, making the essay difficult to follow at times. Simplifying sentence structures and varying them would help create a smoother reading experience. Finally, conventions are a major area for improvement. The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, incorrect spelling, and improper punctuation, all of which impede readability and distract from the argument. A thorough proofreading to correct these mistakes is essential. Overall, while the essay shows promise in engaging with the topic, it needs significant work in clarity, structure, language precision, and grammatical accuracy to fully persuade the reader.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Dear local newspaper, I am writing this letter to you to show on how people get effected from computers. It effects people very well and teaches people many things for just one technology. Computers effects many people for what it does. Computers have many advantages that people learn very quickly. Many people love computers. It is one of the most best inventions to everyone around the world. They teach positive things for people to learn. Computer even have a positive effect on people across\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear stance on the positive effects of computers but lacks depth and specificity in its arguments. The thesis is somewhat ambiguous and repetitive, which diminishes its overall clarity and impact. There is an attempt to develop and support the thesis, but the examples provided are general and unconvincing. For instance, the discussion on hand-eye coordination is not thoroughly explained or supported with concrete evidence. The organization of the essay is basic, with a discernible introduction, body, and conclusion; however, the flow of ideas is somewhat disjointed and lacks smooth transitions. The language used is simplistic and at times redundant, which affects the precision and engagement of the writing. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors and awkward sentence constructions that impede readability. To strengthen the essay, it would benefit from a more precise thesis, richer and more specific examples, improved coherence, and careful attention to language and stylistic choices. Overall, the essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the topic but requires significant refinement to meet the teacher's expectations for clarity, practicality, and precision.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-1-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 1 \nPrompt \nMore and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society.

You should keep reading @CAPS1 essay because I am going to tell you @NUM2 good reasons why I benefit people using computers. @CAPS1 first reason is they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. For example, when I am always using the computer and when I'm doing research it always gives me the ability to learn about new places and people. Another example is when ever I watch @CAPS2.V on @CAPS3 @NUM3 it says that people learn about learn about faraway places and people on the internet @PERCENT1 of the time. @CAPS1 second reason is it allows people to talk online with other people for example when I am on the computer everyday I visit @CAPS1 facebook it always gives me a chance to talk to @CAPS1 friends and other people online. Another example is when I go on a computer and I search computers.org it says that it lets people @PERCENT2 of the time talk to others online. @CAPS1 @NUM4 reason is it allows students to get information when they're doing a project. For example when I always use the @ORGANIZATION1 computers it allows me to get information for example, about @LOCATION2 and @PERSON2 govina that is why I benefit people using computers. Another example is when ever I check out a magazine on computers it tells me that kids get alot of information when they're doing projects @PERCENT2 of the time. In conclusion, I benefit people using computers because they teach hand eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, it allows people to talk online with other people and it allows students to get information when they're doing projects. Those are the @NUM2 reasons why I benefit people using computers.

        "llmResponse": "Dear Student,\n\nThank you for your essay on the benefits of using computers. I appreciate your enthusiasm and the effort you put into detailing your points. Here are some specific suggestions to align your writing more closely with the assignment goals and improve clarity, organization, and effectiveness.\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Clarity of Thesis**: Your thesis is clear; you state that computers offer significant benefits.\n2. **Personal Examples**: You use personal experiences to support your points, which adds a relatable element to your argument.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n\n1. **Organization and Structure**:\n   - **Introduction**: Your introduction should succinctly introduce your main points without unnecessary information. For example, details about your age and school, while interesting, are not crucial to your argument. \n   - **Body**: You present three main reasons why computers benefit people. However, these points would be more compelling if each were developed in separate, clearly defined paragraphs. Each paragraph should start with a topic sentence that introduces the main idea, followed by specific examples and explanations.\n   - **Conclusion**: Your conclusion should summarize your main points without simply repeating them. Aim to leave a lasting impression on the reader.\n\n2. **Content and Examples**:\n   - While you provide examples, they often lack specificity and depth. For instance, when mentioning websites or statistics, ensure they are realistic and credible. Instead of generic sources like \"computers.org\", name concrete and reputable sources.\n   - Strengthen your arguments by explaining how the examples directly support your thesis. For instance, explain how learning about faraway places on the internet contributes to broader knowledge and cultural understanding.\n\n3. **Word Choice and Language**:\n   - Ensure your word choice is precise and varied. Phrases like \"it allows people to talk online\" can be more effectively expressed as \"it facilitates communication with individuals across the globe.\"\n   - Avoid repetition, such as \"learn about faraway places and people,\" which appears multiple times without variation.\n\n4. **Sentence Fluency**:\n   - Your sentences can be more varied in structure to improve the flow. Instead of using \"for example\" repeatedly, try alternative transitions like \"additionally\" or \"in a similar way.\"\n   - Avoid run-on sentences. Break them into smaller, more manageable parts to enhance readability.\n\n5. **Conventions**:\n   - Pay attention to grammar, punctuation, and capitalization. There are several areas where these could be improved, such as ensuring proper noun capitalization (e.g., \"Facebook\" instead of \"facebook\") and correcting spelling errors (\"alot\" should be \"a lot\").\n\n### Revised Example:\nHere\u2019s a revised example to illustrate these suggestions:\n\n**Original**: \"I am a really smart kid. In @CAPS1 opinion I benefit people using computers.\"\n\n**Revised**: \"I believe that my use of computers offers various benefits to myself and others.\"\n\n**Original**: \"For example when I am always using",

        "textSelection": "Does censorship solve any problems?  If one person wants to censor something in a library, there is bound to be another person on the other side of that arguement  trying to protect that work from be taken away.  As a free country, it is every individuals right to take in whatever form of literature or music that they find pleasing, and history has shown the world that censorship leads those in power down a dark road.  The shielding of offensive materials is only necessary and fair when the young, impressionable minds of the world's youth are at stake, but once a person is old enough to make informed decisions, it should be their perrogative to choose their own material.  Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history, but necessary when protecting the young.     It is a person's right to choose what kind of literature they would like to read.  If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned.  For example take a hypothetical public library: a public library is an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music.  A great mental image of serenity and peace.  How does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves?  Suddenly right and left, books are disappearing as if by magic: a ceratin book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad.  Before long, there are not very many books left in this hypothetical library other than books for toddlers.  With this system, everyone suffers.  Everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to.  It would all just be simpler if book were just not banned from libraries.     History has given the world many a cruel dictator.  Oftentimes, once he comes to power, he is not the most popular of governmental forms.  To keep his subjects underneath his rule, often he has to resort to taking away civil rights.  This could be a curfew, fake elections, or censorship.  If the ruler has the power of censorship, he or she can control what the public thinks, feels, and believes.  With this power over them, the people are weakened and often abused.  Now imagine that censorship occuring in a country that has civil rights.  People would not stand for it.  So why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom?  There is absolutely no need for censorship to occur, and as history has shown, it certainly is not a good thing.     Censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights.  There is, however, one other element at play here: protection of youth and innocence.  Almost everyone can remember a time a child when they were young and innocent, free of worry and trouble.  That can disappear in a instant.  Children should not be exposed to things that are innappropriate for their age.  Nearly every movie nowadays has violent and risque, if not full-blown-adult, materials present in it.  The age of innocence is getting younger every generation, and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point.  A claim like this @MONTH1 sound hypotcritical coming from the mouth of one against censorship, but it is not 'censorship' when one is protecting the young.      Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children.  It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon.  The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people.  Also, children should be protected, and that is not censorship.  Censorship solves no problems, but it makes everyone unhappy.  Therefore, why censor",

The main ideas are overly broad and repetitive, failing to engage the reader or provide strong support for the thesis. The essay's organization is weak, with a loose structure that lacks clear transitions and well-defined topic sentences, making it challenging to follow the author's train of thought. The word choice is often inappropriate and imprecise, using informal and incorrect terms such as \"tooken.\" The sentence fluency is mechanical, with awkward constructions that impede readability. Furthermore, the essay contains several grammatical errors, including incorrect verb tense and punctuation issues, which detract from its overall effectiveness. To improve, the author should focus on developing a clear, concise thesis and supporting it with relevant, well-organized arguments and real-world examples. Additionally, attention should be given to refining sentence structure and word choice, as well as proofreading for grammatical accuracy.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

If one person wants to censor something in a library, there is bound to be another person on the other side of that arguement  trying to protect that work from be taken away.  As a free country, it is every individuals right to take in whatever form of literature or music that they find pleasing, and history has shown the world that censorship leads those in power down a dark road.  The shielding of offensive materials is only necessary and fair when the young, impressionable minds of the world's youth are at stake, but once a person is old enough to make informed decisions, it should be their perrogative to choose their own material.  Censorship is unacceptable on the grounds of personal rights and how it has affected history, but necessary when protecting the young.     It is a person's right to choose what kind of literature they would like to read.  If someone does not like a book and it becomes banned from a library, then everyone will want to have a book that they do not like banned.  For example take a hypothetical public library: a public library is an open, free place where men, women, and children of any background can come to learn and enjoy themselves with a good book, magazine, or music.  A great mental image of serenity and peace.  How does this picture appear to a bystander once books begin to disappear off of the shelves?  Suddenly right and left, books are disappearing as if by magic: a ceratin book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad.  Before long, there are not very many books left in this hypothetical library other than books for toddlers.  With this system, everyone suffers.  Everyone should retain their right to read what they would like to.  It would all just be simpler if book were just not banned from libraries.     History has given the world many a cruel dictator.  Oftentimes, once he comes to power, he is not the most popular of governmental forms.  To keep his subjects underneath his rule, often he has to resort to taking away civil rights.  This could be a curfew, fake elections, or censorship.  If the ruler has the power of censorship, he or she can control what the public thinks, feels, and believes.  With this power over them, the people are weakened and often abused.  Now imagine that censorship occuring in a country that has civil rights.  People would not stand for it.  So why begin censorship in an area that promotes freedom?  There is absolutely no need for censorship to occur, and as history has shown, it certainly is not a good thing.     Censorship is unacceptable in all forms in a free country that promotes civil rights.  There is, however, one other element at play here: protection of youth and innocence.  Almost everyone can remember a time a child when they were young and innocent, free of worry and trouble.  That can disappear in a instant.  Children should not be exposed to things that are innappropriate for their age.  Nearly every movie nowadays has violent and risque, if not full-blown-adult, materials present in it.  The age of innocence is getting younger every generation, and children are becoming conditioned to this material to an extreme point.  A claim like this @MONTH1 sound hypotcritical coming from the mouth of one against censorship, but it is not 'censorship' when one is protecting the young.      Due to personal rights and what history has shown the world, censorship should never be tolerated unless on the grounds of protecting children.  It is each person's choice of what they would like to read and absorb, so their choices should not be infringed upon.  The world has seen on several occasions what censorship can do to people.  Also, children should be protected, and that is not censorship.  Censorship solves no problems, but it makes everyone unhappy.  Therefore, why censor\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "### Feedback:\n\n**Content and Argumentation:**\nYour essay provides a compelling argument against censorship, highlighting the potential dangers and historical misuses of such policies, while also addressing the need to protect young minds. This is a strong foundation for your persuasive piece. However, to enhance your argument further, it would be beneficial to include more concrete examples and real-world scenarios. For instance, citing specific instances where censorship has led to negative societal impacts or referring to well-known cases of book banning can help support your claims and make your argument more persuasive.\n\n**Organization:**\nYour essay is generally well-structured, with clear sections that address different aspects of your argument. However, some transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to help maintain the flow of your ideas. For example, the transition between your discussion on personal rights and the historical misuse of censorship could be strengthened by a linking sentence that highlights the connection between individual freedoms and historical abuses.\n\n**Thesis and Conclusion:**\nYour thesis is stated clearly in the introduction, and you return to it effectively in your conclusion, reinforcing your main points. However, consider rephrasing your concluding statement to make it more impactful. Instead of \"Therefore, why censor,\" you might say, \"Therefore, censorship in any form should be avoided to preserve individual freedoms and historical integrity, except in cases where it is necessary to protect children.\"\n\n**Word Choice and Sentence Fluency:**\nYour word choice is mostly effective, but there are a few areas where clarity could be improved. For instance, \"perrogative\" should be corrected to \"prerogative.\" Additionally, varying your sentence structure can help maintain the reader's interest. For example, instead of the repetitive structure in \"a certain book is disapproved of by mothers, a religious group does not like the message this book sends, and this book makes people sad,\" consider rephrasing to add variety and emphasis.\n\n**Conventions:**\nThere are a few grammatical and spelling errors that need attention. Words like \"arguement\" should be corrected to \"argument,\" and \"ceratin\" to \"certain.\" Additionally, ensure that all sentences are complete and correctly punctuated, as there are a few instances of run-on sentences that could be broken down for better readability.\n\n**Actionable Suggestions:**\n1. Incorporate specific historical and contemporary examples to strengthen your argument.\n2. Improve transitions between paragraphs to ensure a smoother flow of ideas.\n3. Vary sentence structures to maintain reader engagement.\n4. Proofread your essay for spelling and grammatical errors to enhance clarity and professionalism.\n5. Rephrase your concluding sentence for a stronger impact.\n\nOverall, you have a solid argument and a clear stance on the issue of censorship. With a few adjustments and refinements, your essay can become even more persuasive and impactful. Keep up the good work and continue to build on these strong foundations.",

First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic response to the prompt by discussing how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, focusing on rolling hills, open terrain, and high deserts. However, it lacks depth and specificity in its supporting details, which limits the clarity and persuasiveness of the arguments. The writer uses some real-world examples but does not fully develop them to support their points effectively. The narrative follows a logical sequence, but transitions between ideas are somewhat abrupt, making the flow less smooth. While the language is generally clear and functional, it shows occasional errors in spelling and grammar, such as \"terran,\" \"hgh,\" and \"mles,\" which detract from the overall readability. Improving the essay would involve elaborating on the points with more detailed and specific examples, enhancing the transitions between ideas for better coherence, and carefully proofreading to correct grammatical errors.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay lacks clarity and practical relevance, making it difficult for the reader to follow the main points. The thesis is neither clear nor well-developed, leaving the intent and purpose of the essay ambiguous. The arguments are simplistic and not supported by real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning, which diminishes their impact. The conclusion is ineffective and fails to reinforce the thesis with practical implications. The organizational structure is weak, with ideas that are not coherently presented or logically connected through clear transitions and defined topic sentences. In terms of language and style, the essay employs a limited vocabulary, with word choices that are often inappropriate for the context, and sentence structures that are awkward and disjointed. The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which further impedes readability and detracts from the essay's overall quality. To improve, the essay needs a clear thesis, well-supported arguments with real-world examples, a logical structure with coherent transitions, appropriate and varied vocabulary, and meticulous attention to grammatical conventions.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The arhuror concludes this story with this paragraph to show people that the story or people in the story have a thing for nature or like writing about nature like whats in nature the change or maybe this story is about nature at its best.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is quite disorganized and lacks clarity and practical focus. The thesis is unclear, and the content is not developed with concrete, real-world evidence or pragmatic reasoning. The argument about the story and nature is repetitive and vague, leaving the reader without a clear understanding of the author's point. Additionally, the conclusion does not effectively reinforce the thesis or provide practical implications. Structurally, the essay falls short of the expected standards. It lacks a coherent organization, with no clear introduction, body, or conclusion. Transitions between ideas are absent, making the essay difficult to follow. The language and style used are inappropriate for the audience and purpose; there are numerous grammatical errors, misspellings, and issues with punctuation and capitalization. Words are often misused, which further obscures the intended meaning. Overall, the essay needs significant revision to improve clarity, practicality, structure, and adherence to standard writing conventions.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

No, a better piece \nof advice for the solo cyclist would be, \u201cNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers \nwho haven\u2019t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.\u201d It\u2019s not that a group of \nold guys doesn\u2019t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid \nplace. Things change. \nAt a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer \nevening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn\u2019t have done was \nlet them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice \nand launched out at first light along a \u201cshortcut\u201d that was to slice away hours from my ride to \nYosemite National Park. \nThey\u2019d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I \nwould come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with \nstrong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first \u201ctown.\u201d \nThis place might have been a thriving little spot at one time\u2014say, before the last world war\u2014but \non that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water \nsupply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool \npines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. \nTwenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, \nand a corral that couldn\u2019t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had \nbeen hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of \nCalifornia in June. \nI got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my \nstrength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the \nneighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water \nwouldn\u2019t cool down. It didn\u2019t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. \nThe old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make \nthat! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so\u2014a test of my inner spirit. \nNot two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was \nreplaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign \njumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. \nThe speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so \ncruel. \nI toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake\u2014it \nreally did look like a diamondback\u2014blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased \npast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. \nThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my \nshirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June \nsimply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn\u2019t been off their porch in decades, \ncaused me to laugh. \nIt was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. \nThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride \ndown into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I\u2019d \nbe fine. \nOver one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make \nsure it wasn\u2019t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst \nof energy, I maneuvered down the hill. \nIn an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building\u2014abandoned years \nearlier, by the looks of it\u2014had been a Welch\u2019s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A \nsandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still \nbe seen. \nI hung my head. \nThat smoky blues tune \u201cSummertime\u201d rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating \nbrain. \nI got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. \nI\u2019d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you \nhave left to circulate. With any luck I\u2019d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. \nIt didn\u2019t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some \nexpensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and \ntheir keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I \nwas going to lose consciousness for the last time. \nSomehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining \nelevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear \nwere all behind me. \nGARY AND WILBER\u2019S FISH CAMP\u2014IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE\u2019RE \nYOUR BEST BET! \n\u201cAnd the only bet,\u201d I remember thinking. \nAs I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an \noverwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait\u2014any bait, even \nthough I didn\u2019t own a rod or reel. \nAn old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from \nmy head as I slumped against the wall beside him. \n\u201cWhere you headed in such a hurry?\u201d \n\u201cYosemite,\u201d I whispered. \n\u201cKnow the best way to get there?\u201d \nI watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group \nI\u2019d listened to in Lodi. \n\u201cYes, sir! I own a very good map.\u201d \nAnd I promised myself right then that I\u2019d always stick to it in the future. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-3-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 3 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nWrite a response that explains how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay demonstrates a good starting point in addressing how the setting affects the cyclist. You've identified several key moments from Joe Kurmaskie's story, such as encountering the ghost town and the harsh desert terrain, which are crucial elements that impact the cyclist's journey. Here are some specific points to help you refine and improve your essay:\n\n1. **Thesis Clarity**:\n   - **Current Sentence**: \"Certin features of the setting affected the cyclist.\"\n   - **Improvement**: Your opening statement is a bit vague. It would be more effective to clearly state how these features specifically impacted the cyclist. For example, you might say, \"The harsh and desolate features of the setting, such as the ghost town and the relentless sun, significantly challenged the cyclist both physically and mentally.\"\n\n2. **Supporting Details and Specificity**:\n   - **Current Sentence**: \"In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes he\u2019s experiences when he cycled through the desert.\"\n   - **Improvement**: This sentence could be more precise. Try: \"Joe Kurmaskie describes his grueling experiences cycling through the unforgiving desert terrain.\"\n   - **Current Sentence**: \"'...arrived at the first town'...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town.\"\n   - **Improvement**: Include the full context to make the quote more meaningful. For example: \"Kurmaskie arrives at what he expected to be a thriving town, only to find a ghost town, underscoring the isolation and desolation of his journey.\"\n\n3. **Logical Flow and Transitions**:\n   - Your essay has some good ideas, but the transitions between them are abrupt. For example, you jump from discussing the ghost town to a quote about the cruelty of life without a clear connection.\n   - **Improvement**: Use transitional phrases to guide the reader. For example, \"As he continues his journey, the initial amusement fades, and the harsh reality sets in as he states, 'sometimes life can be so cruel.'\"\n\n4. **Grammar and Spelling**:\n   - **Current Issues**: There are several spelling errors such as \"Certin\" (certain), \"desribes\" (describes), \"hes\" (his), \"difinition\" (definition), \"scketle\" (skeptical), \"untill\" (until), \"aroun\" (around), \"son\" (sun), and \"soluation\" (solution).\n   - **Improvement**: Proofread your essay to correct these errors. Use tools like spell check or ask a peer to review your work.\n\n5. **Practical Language**:\n   - **Current Sentence**: \"All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water.\"\n   - **Improvement**: \"Surrounded by barren hills under the scorching sun with limited water, the",

First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a basic response to the prompt by discussing how the features of the setting affect the cyclist, focusing on rolling hills, open terrain, and high deserts. However, it lacks depth and specificity in its supporting details, which limits the clarity and persuasiveness of the arguments. The writer uses some real-world examples but does not fully develop them to support their points effectively. The narrative follows a logical sequence, but transitions between ideas are somewhat abrupt, making the flow less smooth. While the language is generally clear and functional, it shows occasional errors in spelling and grammar, such as \"terran,\" \"hgh,\" and \"mles,\" which detract from the overall readability. Improving the essay would involve elaborating on the points with more detailed and specific examples, enhancing the transitions between ideas for better coherence, and carefully proofreading to correct grammatical errors.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay lacks clarity and practical relevance, making it difficult for the reader to follow the main points. The thesis is neither clear nor well-developed, leaving the intent and purpose of the essay ambiguous. The arguments are simplistic and not supported by real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning, which diminishes their impact. The conclusion is ineffective and fails to reinforce the thesis with practical implications. The organizational structure is weak, with ideas that are not coherently presented or logically connected through clear transitions and defined topic sentences. In terms of language and style, the essay employs a limited vocabulary, with word choices that are often inappropriate for the context, and sentence structures that are awkward and disjointed. The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which further impedes readability and detracts from the essay's overall quality. To improve, the essay needs a clear thesis, well-supported arguments with real-world examples, a logical structure with coherent transitions, appropriate and varied vocabulary, and meticulous attention to grammatical conventions.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The arhuror concludes this story with this paragraph to show people that the story or people in the story have a thing for nature or like writing about nature like whats in nature the change or maybe this story is about nature at its best.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is quite disorganized and lacks clarity and practical focus. The thesis is unclear, and the content is not developed with concrete, real-world evidence or pragmatic reasoning. The argument about the story and nature is repetitive and vague, leaving the reader without a clear understanding of the author's point. Additionally, the conclusion does not effectively reinforce the thesis or provide practical implications. Structurally, the essay falls short of the expected standards. It lacks a coherent organization, with no clear introduction, body, or conclusion. Transitions between ideas are absent, making the essay difficult to follow. The language and style used are inappropriate for the audience and purpose; there are numerous grammatical errors, misspellings, and issues with punctuation and capitalization. Words are often misused, which further obscures the intended meaning. Overall, the essay needs significant revision to improve clarity, practicality, structure, and adherence to standard writing conventions.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 3 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit \nby Joe Kurmaskie \nFORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece \nof advice for the solo cyclist would be, \u201cNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers \nwho haven\u2019t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.\u201d It\u2019s not that a group of \nold guys doesn\u2019t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid \nplace. Things change. \nAt a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer \nevening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn\u2019t have done was \nlet them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice \nand launched out at first light along a \u201cshortcut\u201d that was to slice away hours from my ride to \nYosemite National Park. \nThey\u2019d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I \nwould come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with \nstrong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first \u201ctown.\u201d \nThis place might have been a thriving little spot at one time\u2014say, before the last world war\u2014but \non that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water \nsupply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool \npines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. \nTwenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, \nand a corral that couldn\u2019t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had \nbeen hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of \nCalifornia in June. \nI got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my \nstrength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the \nneighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water \nwouldn\u2019t cool down. It didn\u2019t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. \nThe old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make \nthat! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so\u2014a test of my inner spirit. \nNot two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was \nreplaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign \njumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. \nThe speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so \ncruel. \nI toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake\u2014it \nreally did look like a diamondback\u2014blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased \npast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. \nThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my \nshirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June \nsimply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn\u2019t been off their porch in decades, \ncaused me to laugh. \nIt was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. \nThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride \ndown into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I\u2019d \nbe fine. \nOver one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make \nsure it wasn\u2019t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst \nof energy, I maneuvered down the hill. \nIn an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building\u2014abandoned years \nearlier, by the looks of it\u2014had been a Welch\u2019s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A \nsandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still \nbe seen. \nI hung my head. \nThat smoky blues tune \u201cSummertime\u201d rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating \nbrain. \nI got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. \nI\u2019d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you \nhave left to circulate. With any luck I\u2019d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. \nIt didn\u2019t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some \nexpensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and \ntheir keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I \nwas going to lose consciousness for the last time. \nSomehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining \nelevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear \nwere all behind me. \nGARY AND WILBER\u2019S FISH CAMP\u2014IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE\u2019RE \nYOUR BEST BET! \n\u201cAnd the only bet,\u201d I remember thinking. \nAs I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an \noverwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait\u2014any bait, even \nthough I didn\u2019t own a rod or reel. \nAn old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from \nmy head as I slumped against the wall beside him. \n\u201cWhere you headed in such a hurry?\u201d \n\u201cYosemite,\u201d I whispered. \n\u201cKnow the best way to get there?\u201d \nI watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group \nI\u2019d listened to in Lodi. \n\u201cYes, sir! I own a very good map.\u201d \nAnd I promised myself right then that I\u2019d always stick to it in the future. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-3-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 3 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nWrite a response that explains how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.

        "llmResponse": "**Feedback:**\n\nYour essay demonstrates a good attempt at identifying key features of the setting that affect the cyclist. You've made a strong effort to pull specific details from the source text, such as the \"sun beginning to heat down\" and \"run down ghost towns,\" which shows your understanding of the prompt. Here are some areas where you can improve to meet the goals and criteria for success:\n\n1. **Clarity and Specificity**:\n   - Your points are clear but need more specificity and elaboration to strengthen your arguments. For instance, when discussing the sun's effect, you mention that it made the cyclist \"hot and thirsty.\" Enhance this by explaining how this affects his endurance and decision-making during the ride.\n\n2. **Logical Organization and Coherence**:\n   - Your essay would benefit from a more logical organization. Start with a clear thesis statement that outlines the main features you will discuss. Group related ideas together and use transitional phrases to connect them smoothly. For example, you could start with the sun's impact, then move on to the ghost towns, followed by obstacles on the road, and finally, the challenging terrain.\n\n3. **Grammar and Spelling**:\n   - There are noticeable errors that impede the readability of your essay. Phrases like \"THIRSTY-NESS REDUFROM HIM\" and \"THEY DIN'T HAVE ANY WATCH FOR THEM TO FEEL UP WITH\" need correction. Proofreading your work or using grammar-check tools can help you catch and correct these errors.\n\n4. **Practical Language and Real-World Examples**:\n   - Aim to use practical language that is easy to understand. For example, instead of \"SUMMER THE HELL,\" you might say \"climb the steep hill.\" Also, when mentioning obstacles like tumbleweeds and snakes, elaborate on how these specific challenges affect a cyclist in real-world scenarios\u2014this will make your essay more engaging and relatable.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Ensure that your essay has a strong conclusion that ties back to your thesis and summarizes the main points. Reinforce how these features collectively impact the cyclist's journey, emphasizing the practical implications of each.\n\nHere\u2019s a revised version of your introduction to illustrate these points:\n\n**Revised Introduction:**\n\n\"The setting presents numerous challenges that significantly affect the cyclist's journey. One prominent feature is the relentless sun, which not only makes the cyclist hot and thirsty but also forces him to deplete his limited water supply, putting his endurance to the test. Additionally, the desolate ghost towns, with their ramshackle sheds and rusty pumps, contribute to the cyclist's sense of hopelessness and dehydration. Obstacles such as tumbleweeds and pavement-blocking snakes further complicate his progress, slowing him down to a mere 12 mph. Lastly, the long, steep hills exhaust the cyclist, draining his energy as he struggles to navigate the harsh terrain.\"\n\nKeep up the good work and use these suggestions to refine your essay further. Don't hesitate",

The thesis statement is almost non-existent, and there is a lack of coherent development and support for any argument. The single sentence provided does not adequately introduce or conclude the topic, nor does it present a clear opinion or argument regarding the effects computers have on people or censorship in libraries. There are no real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning to support the writer\u2019s stance, which significantly weakens the content. Additionally, the sentence structure is awkward, with grammatical errors that hinder readability. The absence of transitional phrases and logical flow makes the essay difficult to follow.

Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus \nby Minfong Ho \nSaeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng\nwalks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist\nshop to see if the plant can be purchased. \nIt was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat\nleaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in\nseemingly random profusion. \n\u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy\npotted plant by the corner. \nThere, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals\nsplayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of\nrecognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \n\u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. \nA saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with\nvermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into\nthe well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the\nbucket. \nSlowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,\noleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had\nnot even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. \nWhen she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and\ncool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. \nAnd beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with\npurplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to\nsee it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick\nwalls or between tiled roofs. \nAnd that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and\nfound a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.\n\u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said,\nsavoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its\ntag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d \nOne of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed\nher eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could\nalmost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she\ncombed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng\nwould help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. \nSaeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm\naround it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed\ncomb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? \nA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a\nchannel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. \nAnd in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. \nIt was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the\nlast remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.\nAs if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of\nthe onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to\nher. \nHer smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully.\n\u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed\nthe potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. \nMrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere\ndid you get it?\u201d \n\u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \n\u201cHow much?\u201d \nFor answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the \nLambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \n\u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \n\u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \n\u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this\nvegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed\nthe tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \n\u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. \nFor a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the\neye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. \nHer mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful\nplant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \n\u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the\nwords at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t\nas pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.\nThat\u2019s what matters.\u201d \nShe tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her\nother hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d \nShe went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The\nsoil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair\ntrailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There\nwas a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \n\u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. \nMrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and\nstart dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. \nLeft alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it.\nShe could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,\nthe sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth\nwatered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not\neven Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.\nBut she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. \nThe \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.\nOverhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng\nnow. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange\nbefore had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her\nnow.

        "llmResponse": "Thank you for your effort on this essay. I appreciate that you have attempted to understand and explain why the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph. However, there are several areas where you can improve to meet the criteria for success.\n\n1. **Content and Prompt Adherence:**\n   - Your response identifies the concluding paragraph but lacks sufficient depth in explaining its significance. To improve, focus on elaborating why the blossoming of the hibiscus is important to Saeng and how it symbolizes her readiness to try again.\n   - You should include more details and examples from the story to support your points. For instance, refer to how the hibiscus and other plants remind Saeng of her past and her heritage, and how this connection gives her hope and strength.\n\n2. **Language and Grammar:**\n   - Pay attention to the clarity and coherence of your sentences. For example, instead of saying \"I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started,\" you could write, \"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to signify Saeng's determination to try again when the hibiscus blooms, representing a fresh start.\"\n   - Ensure correct use of grammar and punctuation. For example, \"hibiscus is building\" should be \"hibiscus is budding.\"\n\n3. **Organization and Structure:**\n   - Your essay needs a clearer structure, including an introduction that states your thesis, body paragraphs that expand on your points with supporting details, and a conclusion that reinforces your main argument.\n   - Use transitional phrases to help your essay flow more smoothly. For example, you can start with \"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because...\" and then elaborate with \"This is evident when Saeng mentions...\"\n\n4. **Narrativity:**\n   - Make your response more engaging by clearly linking your analysis back to Saeng's experiences and emotions. Describe the connection between the hibiscus blooming and Saeng's personal growth and determination.\n   - Use more varied vocabulary to keep the reader interested. Instead of repeating \"I think,\" try different expressions like \"It appears,\" \"It suggests,\" or \"This implies.\"\n\n**Revised Example:**\n\"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to highlight Saeng's resolve to overcome her challenges. The blooming hibiscus symbolizes renewal and hope, mirroring Saeng's determination to succeed. This is evident when Saeng vows, 'In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.' This statement illustrates her readiness to embrace new beginnings and face her obstacles with renewed vigor.\"\n\nBy focusing on these areas, you can improve the clarity, coherence, and depth of your analysis. Keep practicing and don't hesitate to ask questions if you need further clarification. You're on the right track!",

The thesis statement is almost non-existent, and there is a lack of coherent development and support for any argument. The single sentence provided does not adequately introduce or conclude the topic, nor does it present a clear opinion or argument regarding the effects computers have on people or censorship in libraries. There are no real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning to support the writer\u2019s stance, which significantly weakens the content. Additionally, the sentence structure is awkward, with grammatical errors that hinder readability. The absence of transitional phrases and logical flow makes the essay difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on developing a clear thesis, supporting arguments with concrete examples, and ensuring grammatical accuracy while maintaining a structured and coherent narrative.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provided is extremely difficult to understand due to its lack of clarity and coherence. The thesis is unclear and not relevant to any prompt, making it challenging for the reader to grasp the main idea or argument. The essay does not develop or support its arguments with real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning. Moreover, the structure of the essay is disorganized, with no clear introduction, body, or conclusion, and transitions between ideas are either nonexistent or very awkward. The language and word choice are inappropriate and inconsistent, and there are numerous grammatical errors, including problems with spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which significantly impede readability. Overall, the essay lacks clarity, practicality, real-world relevance, and linguistic precision, failing to meet the basic criteria of the guidelines provided. Improvements in content development, organization, language, and adherence to the prompt are necessary for a higher evaluation.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay lacks clarity and practical relevance, making it difficult for the reader to follow the main points. The thesis is neither clear nor well-developed, leaving the intent and purpose of the essay ambiguous. The arguments are simplistic and not supported by real-world examples or pragmatic reasoning, which diminishes their impact. The conclusion is ineffective and fails to reinforce the thesis with practical implications. The organizational structure is weak, with ideas that are not coherently presented or logically connected through clear transitions and defined topic sentences. In terms of language and style, the essay employs a limited vocabulary, with word choices that are often inappropriate for the context, and sentence structures that are awkward and disjointed. The essay is riddled with grammatical errors, including incorrect spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, which further impedes readability and detracts from the essay's overall quality. To improve, the essay needs a clear thesis, well-supported arguments with real-world examples, a logical structure with coherent transitions, appropriate and varied vocabulary, and meticulous attention to grammatical conventions.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 4 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Winter Hibiscus \nby Minfong Ho \nSaeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng\nwalks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist\nshop to see if the plant can be purchased. \nIt was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat\nleaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in\nseemingly random profusion. \n\u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy\npotted plant by the corner. \nThere, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals\nsplayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of\nrecognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \n\u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. \nA saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with\nvermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into\nthe well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the\nbucket. \nSlowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,\noleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had\nnot even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. \nWhen she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and\ncool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. \nAnd beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with\npurplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to\nsee it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick\nwalls or between tiled roofs. \nAnd that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and\nfound a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.\n\u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said,\nsavoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its\ntag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d \nOne of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed\nher eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could\nalmost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she\ncombed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng\nwould help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. \nSaeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm\naround it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed\ncomb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? \nA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a\nchannel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. \nAnd in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. \nIt was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the\nlast remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.\nAs if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of\nthe onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to\nher. \nHer smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully.\n\u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed\nthe potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. \nMrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere\ndid you get it?\u201d \n\u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \n\u201cHow much?\u201d \nFor answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the \nLambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \n\u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \n\u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \n\u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this\nvegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed\nthe tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \n\u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. \nFor a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the\neye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. \nHer mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful\nplant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \n\u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the\nwords at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake.

Make sure to include concrete examples from the story, such as Saeng\u2019s emotional connection to the hibiscus and her evolving sense of belonging, to strengthen your argument.\n\n2. **Thesis Statement:** Your thesis needs more precision. It should clearly state the main reason why the author ends the story with Saeng's vow. For example, you could say something like, \"The author concludes the story with Saeng's vow because it symbolizes her determination to adapt to her new life while holding onto cherished memories of her past.\"\n\n3. **Logical Organization:** Your essay would benefit from a more structured format. Start with an introduction that includes a clear thesis statement, followed by body paragraphs that provide evidence from the text, and conclude with a summary that reinforces your main argument.\n\n4. **Language and Grammar:** Ensure your language is precise and free of grammatical errors. For example, \"now that shes found\" should be \"now that she's found.\" Improve sentence structure to enhance readability.\n\n5. **Real-World Relevance:** Tie your arguments to real-world concepts where possible. Explain how Saeng\u2019s experience of blending past memories with new realities mirrors the common immigrant experience of finding balance between two cultures.\n\n6. **Transitional Phrases:** Use transitional phrases to help your essay flow better. For example, \"Furthermore,\" \"In addition,\" and \"Therefore,\" can help connect your ideas logically.\n\nHere is a revised version of your thesis and first sentence to guide improvement:\n\n\"The author concludes the story with Saeng\u2019s vow because it symbolizes her growing resolve to embrace her new life while preserving her cultural identity. As she plants the 'winter hibiscus,' a symbol of her past and present, Saeng\u2019s determination to retake the test in the spring reflects her newfound comfort and resilience.\"\n\nRemember, consistent practice and attention to these areas will significantly enhance the clarity, organization, and persuasiveness of your writing. Keep working on integrating specific details from the text and refining your arguments. Good effort!",

The essay's language and style contain several grammatical errors and misspellings, such as \"diffucult,\" \"depresing,\" and \"gratefull.\" Sentence structures are often awkward and lack variety. Additionally, the narrative flow is hindered by the absence of coherent transitions and well-defined topic sentences, making the essay difficult to follow. Overall, the essay needs significant improvement in clarity, organization, and the use of supporting evidence to effectively analyze the mood of the memoir.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 5 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Narciso Rodriguez \nfrom Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives \nMy parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a \nfurnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old \nNarciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon \ncall home. \nIn 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the \nIronbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our \ntraditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared \ncooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking \nthat is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which \nI adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of \nchildhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed \nboth, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. \nGrowing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \u201cfamily\u201d had nothing to do with \nbeing a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, \nCuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation \nprevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these \ncultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of \nhonest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their \nown kind, were clearly in need. \nOur landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and \nAlegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio \nand Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not \nknow my \u201creal\u201d grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were \nallowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and \nRosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family \nmembers came and went \u2014 and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they \nwere able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the \nmany people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. \nMy mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the \nlanguage or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a \nbetter life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country \nthey loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters \nwhile yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were \nstrong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind \nof jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had \nstudied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, \ntaking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their \nchildren to better times drove them to endure these hard times. \nI will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I\u2019ve often told them that what \nthey did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I\u2019ve often told them of \nmy admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I\u2019ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in \nreality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at \nsuch an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two \nlessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these \nteachings have been the basis of my life. \nIt was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to \nthis country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this \nhumble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not \njust scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of \u201cfamily.\u201d \nAnd for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I \nlearned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into \na home. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-5-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 5 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nDescribe the mood created by the author in the memoir.

        "llmResponse": "Thank you for your effort in analyzing the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir. Here are some detailed comments and suggestions to help you improve your essay:\n\n### Strengths:\n1. **Identification of Mood**: You correctly identified that the mood created by the author includes heartwarming and appreciation. This is a great start as it aligns with the memoir's sentiments.\n2. **Use of Quotes**: You have included direct quotes from the memoir, which is an excellent way to support your points. This shows an understanding of the text and an ability to reference specific passages.\n\n### Areas for Improvement:\n1. **Thesis Statement**: Your thesis needs to be clearer and more specific. Currently, it combines two ideas (\"heartwarming and appreciation\") without fully explaining how these moods are developed in the memoir. Try to articulate a clear thesis that outlines the main argument of your essay.\n\n2. **Development of Arguments**: Your essay would benefit from more detailed and structured arguments. For instance, when you mention the author's appreciation for his parents, provide specific examples and elaborate on how these examples contribute to the overall mood of the memoir. Use more quotes and explain their relevance in detail.\n\n3. **Organization and Transitions**: Improve the organization by using clear paragraphs, each focusing on a single point that supports your thesis. Smooth transitions between paragraphs will help the reader follow your train of thought. For example, you could separate the discussion on the heartwarming aspects from the parts that show appreciation, making each section more coherent.\n\n4. **Grammar and Spelling**: There are several grammatical errors and misspellings in your essay, such as \"comftable\" (comfortable), \"enviroment\" (environment), and \"familly\" (family). Proofreading your work and using tools like spell check can help eliminate these errors.\n\n5. **Clarity and Sentence Structure**: Some sentences are confusing or awkwardly structured. For instance, \"Not only Just being together but being together\" is redundant. Aim for clear and concise sentences. Also, ensure each sentence contributes to your argument.\n\n### Practical Suggestions:\n- **Revise Your Thesis**: Try something like, \"In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood of warmth and appreciation by illustrating the close-knit nature of his family and their sacrifices for a better life.\"\n- **Expand on Key Points**: When discussing how the home was heartwarming, mention specific family traditions or community interactions that exemplify this mood. Similarly, for appreciation, discuss specific sacrifices his parents made and how they impacted the author's life.\n- **Paragraph Structure**: Start with a topic sentence for each paragraph that clearly states the main point. Follow with evidence from the text and an explanation of how this evidence supports your point.\n- **Proofreading**: After writing, take the time to read your essay aloud or ask someone else to review it. This can help catch errors and improve the overall readability of your essay.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions",

        "textSelection": "Most modern day book, movies, music, etc. do a fairly good job of placing warning in the form of '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticks on their covers. But books from before this practice began to happen @MONTH1 be found more offensive then books today. Why? Well, that's because many books of the past use words that today are found offensive. But those books, movies, and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem. There are examples of how each catagory is in today's society.     Take the book 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', written by @PERSON1, for example. In that story, there are words that are used to describe people of that time.. Back when @PERSON1 wrote the book, it was perfectly fine to use those words on those people, but in today's modern world, that is a book that has been on the list for being banned. It is offensive to use that word on people today, so parent groups and others are trying to get that book pulled off of shelves in hopes of erasing what was done in the past. I don't believe that a book should be banned for it's content, but rather how well it teaches its reader through its words. If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and the culture of that time, then it shouldn't be banned at all. It should be read.     Movies have a rating system for a reason. There are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience. People must be of a certain age to rent, buy, or view these kind of movies 'leagally'. Not too many people listen to that system, even though it has exsisted for years. A horror film is not suitable for a @CAPS15 of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on @CAPS4. Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a @CAPS15 nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong. That is the fault of the parents. They were the ones who let their @CAPS15 watch that movie in the first place. So the movie shouldn't be held responsible for the @CAPS15. If the movie was intended for a more mature audience, that's the way it should stay.     And that brings us to music. There is a lot of music in today's age that can be considered very offensive. There are only a few 'pure' genres, free of the cursing that is used in many of the others today. But children, teen, and adults all find their favorite kind, and you can't change their minds then. The governement has issued that all music containing harsh words, horrid images to the mind, gruesome scenes, and other elements that are offensive to people, must carry a sticker on it. The black and white '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticker. When parents see this sticker on the @CAPS7, @NUM1 download, or whatever their @CAPS15 is using, then they know that it is more than likely not right for their @CAPS15 to listen to. Doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it means that there is a slight chance that their minds will not be tainted by 'garbage'.     So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't neccessarily mean that it is the same to another person. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society. People will still argue that books such as 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON2', '@CAPS10 in the @CAPS11', and many, many more books like them should be banned. They will always fight that movies such as 'A @CAPS12 on @CAPS13 @CAPS14,' '@DATE1 the @NUM2', or '@CAPS15's @CAPS16' should be removed from store shelves because it gave them nightmares as a @CAPS19 or it gives their @CAPS15 nightmares because they saw it. And they will always try to fight and say that artist like @CAPS17' @CAPS18, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS19 @CAPS20 are not suited for their @CAPS15. Well, this pattern has been going on for years. Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for a adult audience, not for a @CAPS15 of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue about what should be on shelves and what should not, remember that it might be that parent's fault for letting their @CAPS15 view it in the first place.",

But books from before this practice began to happen @MONTH1 be found more offensive then books today. Why? Well, that's because many books of the past use words that today are found offensive. But those books, movies, and music are not at fault like parents try to make it seem. There are examples of how each catagory is in today's society.     Take the book 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', written by @PERSON1, for example. In that story, there are words that are used to describe people of that time.. Back when @PERSON1 wrote the book, it was perfectly fine to use those words on those people, but in today's modern world, that is a book that has been on the list for being banned. It is offensive to use that word on people today, so parent groups and others are trying to get that book pulled off of shelves in hopes of erasing what was done in the past. I don't believe that a book should be banned for it's content, but rather how well it teaches its reader through its words. If it can teach a student in a high school or college class about the history and the culture of that time, then it shouldn't be banned at all. It should be read.     Movies have a rating system for a reason. There are some movies that are just not meant for a younger audience. People must be of a certain age to rent, buy, or view these kind of movies 'leagally'. Not too many people listen to that system, even though it has exsisted for years. A horror film is not suitable for a @CAPS15 of a young age who believes everything he or she sees on @CAPS4. Movies shouldn't be banned just because it gives a @CAPS15 nightmares or makes them not as emotionally aware of what is right or wrong. That is the fault of the parents. They were the ones who let their @CAPS15 watch that movie in the first place. So the movie shouldn't be held responsible for the @CAPS15. If the movie was intended for a more mature audience, that's the way it should stay.     And that brings us to music. There is a lot of music in today's age that can be considered very offensive. There are only a few 'pure' genres, free of the cursing that is used in many of the others today. But children, teen, and adults all find their favorite kind, and you can't change their minds then. The governement has issued that all music containing harsh words, horrid images to the mind, gruesome scenes, and other elements that are offensive to people, must carry a sticker on it. The black and white '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sticker. When parents see this sticker on the @CAPS7, @NUM1 download, or whatever their @CAPS15 is using, then they know that it is more than likely not right for their @CAPS15 to listen to. Doesn't mean that the parent is actually going to listen all the time, but it means that there is a slight chance that their minds will not be tainted by 'garbage'.     So, in conclusion, I believe that movies, books, and music that contain 'offensive' material should not be removed from shelves. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't neccessarily mean that it is the same to another person. There are ratings on things for a reason, to keep children from seeing them and to help with the level of harshness that is given to today's society. People will still argue that books such as 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON2', '@CAPS10 in the @CAPS11', and many, many more books like them should be banned. They will always fight that movies such as 'A @CAPS12 on @CAPS13 @CAPS14,' '@DATE1 the @NUM2', or '@CAPS15's @CAPS16' should be removed from store shelves because it gave them nightmares as a @CAPS19 or it gives their @CAPS15 nightmares because they saw it. And they will always try to fight and say that artist like @CAPS17' @CAPS18, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS19 @CAPS20 are not suited for their @CAPS15. Well, this pattern has been going on for years. Those books were made many years before, those movies are intended for a adult audience, not for a @CAPS15 of a young age, and those artists are just trying to make money like everyone else. So when parents try to argue about what should be on shelves and what should not, remember that it might be that parent's fault for letting their @CAPS15 view it in the first place.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",

Provide feedback that is aligned with the teacher's style and the class needs. Use all of the information at your disposable to customize to the teacher and class. Take the teacher instruction into account, in case they emphasize specifically what they want you to do.\n\n---------------------------\n\n----- TEACHER PERSONA -----\nHere is a persona of the teacher. Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.\n\n**Teacher Persona:**\n\n- **Goal-Oriented:** \n  - Highest priority is nurturing and cultivating students' ability to express themselves creatively and originally through writing.\n  - Focuses on encouraging innovative thinking and rewarding unique ideas.\n  - Aims for students to feel confident in developing and presenting their thoughts in a way that showcases individuality and imaginative perspectives.\n\n- **Teaching Style:**\n  - Anchored in fostering originality and creative expression.\n  - Creates an environment where students are encouraged to take risks in their writing and explore new ideas without fear of judgment.\n\n- **Feedback Approach:**\n  - Prioritizes constructive comments that inspire further thought and creativity.\n  - Highlights students' unique and imaginative contributions before offering suggestions for improvement.\n  - Tailors feedback to each student's specific strengths and areas for growth, emphasizing enhancement of their creative voice.\n\n- **Student Interaction:**\n  - Approachable and supportive demeanor.\n  - Engages with students as individuals, understanding their unique perspectives.\n  - Encourages students to express their perspectives confidently.\n  - Values dialogue and invites students to discuss their ideas, facilitating a collaborative and dynamic learning experience.\n\n- **Classroom Environment:**\n  - Nurtures an environment where creativity flourishes.\n  - Celebrates original thinking.\n  - Empowers students to push the boundaries of their expression.\n\n\n\n----- FEEDBACK -----\nHere are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to discuss the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the story. The ideas are underdeveloped and the content is minimal, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the intended message. There is a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points being made, which weakens the overall argument. The response also tends to wander off-topic and does not adhere closely to the prompt. The language used is simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors, such as \"shes\" instead of \"she's\" and \"sentance\" instead of \"sentence.\" These errors distract from the readability of the essay and hinder its effectiveness. Additionally, the essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes the narrative difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing detailed support from the story, maintaining clarity in addressing the prompt, enhancing vocabulary, and ensuring a smooth flow of ideas with proper transitions.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: According to @PERSON1, economic @CAPS1, every hour you spend on the computer, you raise your electricity bill by @MONEY2. The average @CAPS2 spends @NUM1 hours on the computer everyday. I believe that spending too much time on the computer could be a bad thing. You have economic loss from the electric bill, health loss because you won't be able to exercise as much, and community less because you won't spen as much with your community. Financial loss is something that many people are concerned\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and focused argument against excessive computer use, supported by recognizable main ideas: financial loss, health issues, and community disintegration. The originality of the thesis could be improved by providing a more unique or thought-provoking perspective on the topic. The essay is satisfactorily organized, with a basic introduction, body, and conclusion, though the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow of ideas. The word choice effectively conveys the intended message, but there is room for more varied and imaginative language to make the essay more engaging. The sentences generally flow well, though some constructions could be more fluid and varied to maintain the reader\u2019s interest.

Many people are talking about how americans are becoming obise. Part @MONEY1 this is due to spending too much time on the computer. Proffesor @CAPS3 @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 says that, \"the obisety in @LOCATION1 is a problem, if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, that problem would be solved.\" @CAPS4, @NUM5 out @MONEY1 @NUM6 people are obese. If everyone spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, it would become @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM6.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and focused argument against excessive computer use, supported by recognizable main ideas: financial loss, health issues, and community disintegration. The originality of the thesis could be improved by providing a more unique or thought-provoking perspective on the topic. The essay is satisfactorily organized, with a basic introduction, body, and conclusion, though the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow of ideas. The word choice effectively conveys the intended message, but there is room for more varied and imaginative language to make the essay more engaging. The sentences generally flow well, though some constructions could be more fluid and varied to maintain the reader\u2019s interest. The essay demonstrates control of standard writing conventions, but there are noticeable errors in spelling and grammar that slightly impede readability. Overall, the essay is clear and persuasive but could benefit from more creative expression and polished language use to fully align with the teacher's emphasis on originality and creative expression.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

I chuckled, checked my water \nsupply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool \npines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. \nTwenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, \nand a corral that couldn\u2019t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had \nbeen hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of \nCalifornia in June. \nI got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my \nstrength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the \nneighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water \nwouldn\u2019t cool down. It didn\u2019t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. \nThe old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make \nthat! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so\u2014a test of my inner spirit. \nNot two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.

Wide rings of dried sweat circled my \nshirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June \nsimply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn\u2019t been off their porch in decades, \ncaused me to laugh. \nIt was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. \nThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride \ndown into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I\u2019d \nbe fine. \nOver one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make \nsure it wasn\u2019t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst \nof energy, I maneuvered down the hill. \nIn an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building\u2014abandoned years \nearlier, by the looks of it\u2014had been a Welch\u2019s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant.

Many of these features affect him in a negative way. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said \u0093Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit\u0094 \u0093The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.\u0094 The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist. \u0093I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.\u0094 All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Your essay on \"Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit\" does a commendable job of identifying several key features of the setting and their impact on the cyclist. I appreciate your effort to pinpoint specific elements, such as the hills, the road sign, and the grape juice advertisement, and discuss how they contribute to the character\u2019s experience. These are excellent observations and show that you are engaging thoughtfully with the text.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Identification of Setting Elements:** You have successfully identified several features of the setting that affect the cyclist, such as the hills, the road sign, and the grape juice advertisement. This shows good attention to detail and an understanding of how setting influences narrative.\n   \n2. **Use of Quotes:** Incorporating direct quotes from the text adds strength to your argument. It demonstrates that you are closely reading and using the source material to support your points.\n\n3. **Creative Interpretation:** Your interpretation of the cyclist\u2019s feelings, especially regarding the ironic grape juice advertisement, is both original and insightful. This kind of creative thinking is exactly what I aim to foster in this class.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Depth and Development:** While you have identified several key features, your analysis could benefit from deeper exploration. For example, you mention the hills but don't fully delve into how they physically and mentally challenge the cyclist. Try to expand on each point to give a more comprehensive picture.\n\n2. **Narrative Flow:** Your essay could improve in terms of narrative flow. Ensure that your ideas transition smoothly from one to the next. Using transitional phrases can help guide your reader through your arguments more coherently.\n\n3. **Language Variety:** Your vocabulary is functional, but there is room to incorporate more varied and imaginative language. This can help make your essay more engaging and reflective of your unique voice.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** Your conclusion could be a bit stronger. Instead of just summarizing the negative effects, you might want to reflect on what these hardships say about the cyclist\u2019s character or the broader theme of the essay. This will add depth to your analysis and leave your reader with something to ponder.\n\n**Suggestions for Enhancement:**\n\n- **Expand on Examples:** Take each feature you mention and expand on it. Discuss not just how it affects the cyclist immediately, but what it signifies in the context of the essay. For instance, what do the hills symbolize in his journey?\n  \n- **Improve Transitions:** Use phrases like \"Furthermore,\" \"In addition to,\" or \"As a result,\" to link your ideas more seamlessly.\n\n- **Enhance Vocabulary:** Consider using more descriptive adjectives and varied sentence structures to keep your reader engaged. For example, instead of \u201cexasperated,\u201d you might say \u201cthe relentless hills exacerbated his exhaustion.\u201d\n\nOverall, you are on the right track with identifying and discussing the setting\u2019s impact on the cyclist. With a bit more depth and creative flair, your analysis could shine even brighter. Keep pushing the boundaries of your expression and",

Your arguments are focused and supported with relevant examples, such as the use of social media platforms like MySpace and Facebook for maintaining long-distance relationships, and the necessity of computers for business and research purposes. The introduction succinctly sets the stage for your argument, and the conclusion effectively reinforces your main points while offering practical advice on balancing computer use with other activities.\n\nHowever, the structure of the essay could be improved for better readability. Organizing your points into distinct paragraphs with smooth transitions would enhance the flow of ideas.

Additionally, while your vocabulary is appropriate and varied, further refinement in word choice could add more precision and interest to your writing.\n\nYour sentence structures are varied and mostly effective, contributing to a smooth reading experience. Still, addressing some repetitive phrases and minor grammatical errors would elevate the overall quality. For instance, consistent capitalization, punctuation, and spelling accuracy are essential for clear communication, even though creative deviations are acceptable. \n\nOverall, your essay is engaging and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. With some improvements in organization and attention to detail in language use, your writing will be even more impactful and enjoyable to read.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: it helps you to communicate with your friends.

Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to discuss the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the story. The ideas are underdeveloped and the content is minimal, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the intended message. There is a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points being made, which weakens the overall argument. The response also tends to wander off-topic and does not adhere closely to the prompt. The language used is simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors, such as \"shes\" instead of \"she's\" and \"sentance\" instead of \"sentence.\" These errors distract from the readability of the essay and hinder its effectiveness. Additionally, the essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes the narrative difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing detailed support from the story, maintaining clarity in addressing the prompt, enhancing vocabulary, and ensuring a smooth flow of ideas with proper transitions.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

For example the road, the rocks everything close. The cyclist needs to know everything about where he's going, because if not then he can run into some problems along the way, For example like snakes, rough terrain, rocks in the way. That why its important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves. That why when you see cyclist you see them around, a road where theres cars around, just in case they get into trouble.\nTEACHER INSTRUCTION: Please provide feedback on the student's writing in alignment with my values.\nFEEDBACK: \n",
        "llmResponse": "Your response offers a solid foundation by identifying some of the obstacles the cyclist faces, like rough terrain and snakes. You've recognized the importance of a cyclist being aware of their environment and the potential dangers that can arise from trusting unreliable sources. This is a great starting point, and it shows your ability to engage with the text and think critically about the challenges presented.\n\nTo further improve and enhance your creative expression, consider adding more specific examples from the source text to support your points. For instance, when you mention the \"rocks in the way,\" you could describe the moment when the cyclist encounters a large snake or the abandoned town, which adds vividness to your narrative and grounds your arguments in the source material. \n\nMoreover, organizing your ideas into clear and distinct paragraphs will help in making your essay more coherent and easier to follow. For example, you could have one paragraph focusing on the physical challenges, like the rough terrain and weather conditions, and another on the psychological aspects, such as the cyclist's reliance on his own judgment over the advice of others.\n\nYour conclusion can also benefit from a stronger closing remark that ties back to the cyclist's journey and the lessons learned from their experience. Perhaps reflect on how these difficulties ultimately contribute to the cyclist's growth and resilience.\n\nLastly, pay attention to minor grammatical and spelling errors, such as \"that why\" instead of \"that's why.\" This will enhance the readability and professionalism of your writing.\n\nOverall, your essay has a strong grasp of the central themes, and with some additional details and structural improvements, it has the potential to be even more impactful and engaging. Keep pushing those creative boundaries!",

Use this to help with impersonating them when writing feedback.\n\n**Teacher Persona:**\n\n- **Goal-Oriented:** \n  - Highest priority is nurturing and cultivating students' ability to express themselves creatively and originally through writing.\n  - Focuses on encouraging innovative thinking and rewarding unique ideas.\n  - Aims for students to feel confident in developing and presenting their thoughts in a way that showcases individuality and imaginative perspectives.\n\n- **Teaching Style:**\n  - Anchored in fostering originality and creative expression.\n  - Creates an environment where students are encouraged to take risks in their writing and explore new ideas without fear of judgment.\n\n- **Feedback Approach:**\n  - Prioritizes constructive comments that inspire further thought and creativity.\n  - Highlights students' unique and imaginative contributions before offering suggestions for improvement.\n  - Tailors feedback to each student's specific strengths and areas for growth, emphasizing enhancement of their creative voice.\n\n- **Student Interaction:**\n  - Approachable and supportive demeanor.\n  - Engages with students as individuals, understanding their unique perspectives.\n  - Encourages students to express their perspectives confidently.\n  - Values dialogue and invites students to discuss their ideas, facilitating a collaborative and dynamic learning experience.\n\n- **Classroom Environment:**\n  - Nurtures an environment where creativity flourishes.\n  - Celebrates original thinking.\n  - Empowers students to push the boundaries of their expression.\n\n\n\n----- FEEDBACK -----\nHere are examples of feedback the teacher has given to students.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: outside they don't talk to there friends or even see ther friends its mostly not haven a life. And people dont feel like going to school because their over and there tired and ther just want to use the computer all day with not stopping. And so i think that people are just to addicted to compulers they dont use it for the fright reasons. Had then people get sick they could get hoadaks or they feel like puking. And they dont get to see that of things like go to the @CAPS1, @CAPS2 football,\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay demonstrates an attempt to discuss the impact of computer usage on individuals, but it lacks clarity and effective organization. The main ideas are present but not fully developed or supported with specific details, making the overall argument somewhat simplistic and broad. The essay's structure is disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a need for a clearer flow of ideas. The language used is repetitive and often inappropriate, with many words misused or misspelled, which detracts significantly from the intended message. Sentence structures are awkward and lack fluidity, causing the reader to frequently pause and reread for comprehension. Additionally, the essay contains numerous grammatical errors, incorrect punctuation, and inconsistent capitalization, which further impede readability. However, there are moments of creative expression, and the writer's point of view is clearly stated, though it requires more refinement and stronger support to be more persuasive and engaging. Improving these areas with a focus on originality and imaginative language use, while maintaining grammatical accuracy, will enhance the overall quality of the essay.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to discuss the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the story. The ideas are underdeveloped and the content is minimal, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the intended message. There is a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points being made, which weakens the overall argument. The response also tends to wander off-topic and does not adhere closely to the prompt. The language used is simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors, such as \"shes\" instead of \"she's\" and \"sentance\" instead of \"sentence.\" These errors distract from the readability of the essay and hinder its effectiveness. Additionally, the essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes the narrative difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing detailed support from the story, maintaining clarity in addressing the prompt, enhancing vocabulary, and ensuring a smooth flow of ideas with proper transitions.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: loss there is also a health issue. Many people are talking about how americans are becoming obise. Part @MONEY1 this is due to spending too much time on the computer. Proffesor @CAPS3 @MONEY1 @ORGANIZATION1 says that, \"the obisety in @LOCATION1 is a problem, if people spent less time on the computer and more time exercising, that problem would be solved.\" @CAPS4, @NUM5 out @MONEY1 @NUM6 people are obese. If everyone spent @NUM2 less hour on the computer, it would become @NUM1 out @MONEY1 @NUM6.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a clear and focused argument against excessive computer use, supported by recognizable main ideas: financial loss, health issues, and community disintegration. The originality of the thesis could be improved by providing a more unique or thought-provoking perspective on the topic. The essay is satisfactorily organized, with a basic introduction, body, and conclusion, though the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the flow of ideas. The word choice effectively conveys the intended message, but there is room for more varied and imaginative language to make the essay more engaging. The sentences generally flow well, though some constructions could be more fluid and varied to maintain the reader\u2019s interest. The essay demonstrates control of standard writing conventions, but there are noticeable errors in spelling and grammar that slightly impede readability. Overall, the essay is clear and persuasive but could benefit from more creative expression and polished language use to fully align with the teacher's emphasis on originality and creative expression.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 3 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit \nby Joe Kurmaskie \nFORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece \nof advice for the solo cyclist would be, \u201cNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers \nwho haven\u2019t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.\u201d It\u2019s not that a group of \nold guys doesn\u2019t know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid \nplace. Things change. \nAt a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer \nevening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn\u2019t have done was \nlet them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice \nand launched out at first light along a \u201cshortcut\u201d that was to slice away hours from my ride to \nYosemite National Park. \nThey\u2019d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I \nwould come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with \nstrong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first \u201ctown.\u201d \nThis place might have been a thriving little spot at one time\u2014say, before the last world war\u2014but \non that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water \nsupply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool \npines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. \nTwenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, \nand a corral that couldn\u2019t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had \nbeen hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of \nCalifornia in June. \nI got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my \nstrength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the \nneighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water \nwouldn\u2019t cool down. It didn\u2019t matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. \nThe old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make \nthat! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so\u2014a test of my inner spirit. \nNot two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was \nreplaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign \njumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. \nThe speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so \ncruel. \nI toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake\u2014it \nreally did look like a diamondback\u2014blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased \npast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. \nThe water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my \nshirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June \nsimply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn\u2019t been off their porch in decades, \ncaused me to laugh. \nIt was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. \nThere was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride \ndown into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I\u2019d \nbe fine. \nOver one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make \nsure it wasn\u2019t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst \nof energy, I maneuvered down the hill. \nIn an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building\u2014abandoned years \nearlier, by the looks of it\u2014had been a Welch\u2019s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A \nsandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still \nbe seen. \nI hung my head. \nThat smoky blues tune \u201cSummertime\u201d rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating \nbrain. \nI got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. \nI\u2019d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you \nhave left to circulate. With any luck I\u2019d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. \nIt didn\u2019t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some \nexpensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and \ntheir keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I \nwas going to lose consciousness for the last time. \nSomehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining \nelevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear \nwere all behind me. \nGARY AND WILBER\u2019S FISH CAMP\u2014IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE\u2019RE \nYOUR BEST BET! \n\u201cAnd the only bet,\u201d I remember thinking. \nAs I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an \noverwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait\u2014any bait, even \nthough I didn\u2019t own a rod or reel. \nAn old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from \nmy head as I slumped against the wall beside him. \n\u201cWhere you headed in such a hurry?\u201d \n\u201cYosemite,\u201d I whispered. \n\u201cKnow the best way to get there?\u201d \nI watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group \nI\u2019d listened to in Lodi. \n\u201cYes, sir! I own a very good map.\u201d \nAnd I promised myself right then that I\u2019d always stick to it in the future. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-3-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 3 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nWrite a response that explains how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.

        "llmResponse": "Your essay touches on an important aspect of the story: how the setting impacts the cyclist\u2019s experience. You\u2019ve identified several key points about the relationship between the setting and the cyclist\u2019s physical and mental state. This is a great start! Let\u2019s work on developing these ideas further to make your essay even more compelling.\n\nFirstly, your observation that a pleasant setting can distract the cyclist from pain is insightful. Can you provide specific examples from the text to support this point? For instance, when the cyclist is enjoying the early summer evening at the reservoir campground, how does this influence his mood and energy?\n\nSimilarly, your point about an unpleasant setting intensifying the rider\u2019s discomfort is well-taken. Again, referring to specific instances in the story\u2014like the encounter with the ghost town or the dehydrating desert\u2014would strengthen your argument. How do these settings affect the cyclist\u2019s morale and physical condition?\n\nYour mention of hilly terrain and its effect on the cyclist\u2019s pain and dehydration is accurate and relevant. Can you delve deeper into this and perhaps describe the struggle the cyclist faces as he tackles these hills? The more detailed you are, the more vivid and engaging your essay will become.\n\nAdditionally, consider varying your sentence structure and word choice to make your writing more fluid and engaging. Instead of saying, \u201cthe setting really does affect the cyclist,\u201d you could try something like, \u201cIt is evident that the cyclist\u2019s journey and overall experience are profoundly shaped by the setting.\u201d\n\nRemember, originality and creative expression are key. Think about how you can present these observations in a way that showcases your unique perspective. How does the setting not only affect the cyclist but also relate to the larger themes of the story, such as resilience and the unpredictability of life?\n\nOverall, you\u2019ve laid a solid foundation. With more specific examples from the text and a bit more creative language, your essay can truly shine. Keep pushing the boundaries of your expression, and don\u2019t be afraid to take risks in your writing. Great job so far\u2014keep it up!",

Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay attempts to discuss the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the essence of the story. The ideas are underdeveloped and the content is minimal, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the intended message. There is a noticeable absence of specific examples from the story to support the points being made, which weakens the overall argument. The response also tends to wander off-topic and does not adhere closely to the prompt. The language used is simplistic and riddled with grammatical errors, such as \"shes\" instead of \"she's\" and \"sentance\" instead of \"sentence.\" These errors distract from the readability of the essay and hinder its effectiveness. Additionally, the essay lacks a coherent structure, with ideas presented in a disjointed manner that makes the narrative difficult to follow. To improve, the writer should focus on providing detailed support from the story, maintaining clarity in addressing the prompt, enhancing vocabulary, and ensuring a smooth flow of ideas with proper transitions.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: he really has a family, that show they care. He appreciates what his parents have done for him. You can tell his very greatful because of the way he expresses himself about his family. \"In reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spint of generosity impressed upon me, and demonstrate of how important family and friends are\". He is a caring young boy.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a genuine effort to explore the theme of family gratitude in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, but it lacks the originality and creative expression that could elevate it. While it includes specific quotations from the memoir, the analysis remains superficial and doesn't delve deeply into the unique aspects of Rodriguez's experiences or emotions. The introduction could be more engaging, and the body paragraphs would benefit from smoother transitions and more innovative development of arguments. The vocabulary and sentence structures are fairly basic, and there are several grammatical errors, such as inconsistencies in the spelling of \"grateful\" and issues with punctuation and capitalization. Additionally, the essay could improve its narrative flow by enhancing the use of transitional words and providing a more conversational tone. Overall, while the essay addresses some of the key points from the memoir, it would benefit from a more creative approach and a deeper analysis to fully capture the essence of Rodriguez's gratitude towards his family.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: c.The mood in this passage Narciso Rodriguez's home, nationality, and his family. He often talks about his nationality. He is proud to be born in Cuba and not afraid to say it. He is also married. He lives in the @DATE1's. In america. He also often talks about his @NUM1 bedroom apartment in Newark, New Jersey. He aslo likes to talk about the new freinds he mad here. And his family. Also Narciso childhood. His neighborhood is made out of cubans, And @CAPS1. That was the memoir of this passage.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a minimal understanding of the content about Narciso Rodriguez's background and experiences. While it mentions his Cuban nationality and pride, as well as his residence in Newark and family dynamics, it lacks specificity and depth in its supporting arguments. The response does not effectively utilize evidence from the memoir to strengthen its points, leading to a surface-level engagement with the topic. In terms of language, the essay demonstrates adequate grammar and spelling, with some minor errors and a limited range of vocabulary. The structure is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of cohesive flow between ideas, making it challenging to follow the narrative smoothly. Enhancing the originality and creativity in the development of the thesis, supporting arguments, and conclusion would greatly improve the overall quality of the essay. Additionally, incorporating a more engaging introduction and imaginative use of language and sentence structures would elevate the essay's appeal.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment.

As Saeng\nwalks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist\nshop to see if the plant can be purchased. \nIt was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat\nleaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in\nseemingly random profusion. \n\u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy\npotted plant by the corner. \nThere, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals\nsplayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of\nrecognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \n\u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. \nA saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with\nvermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into\nthe well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the\nbucket. \nSlowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes,\noleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had\nnot even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. \nWhen she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and\ncool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. \nAnd beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with\npurplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to\nsee it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick\nwalls or between tiled roofs. \nAnd that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and\nfound a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.\n\u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said,\nsavoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its\ntag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d \nOne of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed\nher eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could\nalmost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she\ncombed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng\nwould help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. \nSaeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm\naround it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed\ncomb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? \nA wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a\nchannel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone. \nAnd in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. \nIt was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the\nlast remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk.\nAs if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of\nthe onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to\nher. \nHer smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully.\n\u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed\nthe potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. \nMrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere\ndid you get it?\u201d \n\u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \n\u201cHow much?\u201d \nFor answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the \nLambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \n\u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \n\u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \n\u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this\nvegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed\nthe tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \n\u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. \nFor a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the\neye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. \nHer mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful\nplant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \n\u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the\nwords at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t\nas pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.\nThat\u2019s what matters.\u201d \nShe tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her\nother hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d \nShe went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The\nsoil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair\ntrailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There\nwas a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \n\u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. \nMrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and\nstart dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. \nLeft alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it.\nShe could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl,\nthe sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth\nwatered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not\neven Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue.\nBut she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. \nThe \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it.\nOverhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng\nnow. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange\nbefore had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her\nnow. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against\nthe evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. \nWhen they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the\ngeese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-4-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 4 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nRead the last paragraph of the story. \n\"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and\nthe geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.\" \nWrite a response that explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.

He often talks about his nationality. He is proud to be born in Cuba and not afraid to say it. He is also married. He lives in the @DATE1's. In america. He also often talks about his @NUM1 bedroom apartment in Newark, New Jersey. He aslo likes to talk about the new freinds he mad here. And his family. Also Narciso childhood. His neighborhood is made out of cubans, And @CAPS1. That was the memoir of this passage.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a minimal understanding of the content about Narciso Rodriguez's background and experiences. While it mentions his Cuban nationality and pride, as well as his residence in Newark and family dynamics, it lacks specificity and depth in its supporting arguments. The response does not effectively utilize evidence from the memoir to strengthen its points, leading to a surface-level engagement with the topic. In terms of language, the essay demonstrates adequate grammar and spelling, with some minor errors and a limited range of vocabulary. The structure is somewhat disjointed, with abrupt transitions and a lack of cohesive flow between ideas, making it challenging to follow the narrative smoothly. Enhancing the originality and creativity in the development of the thesis, supporting arguments, and conclusion would greatly improve the overall quality of the essay. Additionally, incorporating a more engaging introduction and imaginative use of language and sentence structures would elevate the essay's appeal.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: Narciso Rodriguez is very grateful of his family. During this memoir he is very excited and thankful for the family he has. Like was said in the memoir \"I will always be greatful of my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 example of how Narciso show that he is greatful is \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, @CAPS2 thanked them repeatedly\". Narciso says he really has a family, that show they care. He appreciates what his parents have done for him.\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay presents a genuine effort to explore the theme of family gratitude in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, but it lacks the originality and creative expression that could elevate it. While it includes specific quotations from the memoir, the analysis remains superficial and doesn't delve deeply into the unique aspects of Rodriguez's experiences or emotions. The introduction could be more engaging, and the body paragraphs would benefit from smoother transitions and more innovative development of arguments. The vocabulary and sentence structures are fairly basic, and there are several grammatical errors, such as inconsistencies in the spelling of \"grateful\" and issues with punctuation and capitalization. Additionally, the essay could improve its narrative flow by enhancing the use of transitional words and providing a more conversational tone. Overall, while the essay addresses some of the key points from the memoir, it would benefit from a more creative approach and a deeper analysis to fully capture the essence of Rodriguez's gratitude towards his family.\n\n======= FEEDBACK EXAMPLE =======\nSTUDENT ESSAY TEXT: The mood created in the memoir is thoughtful and caring. \"I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. Narciso is very thankful and feels very much beloved in his family. In the mood in this memoir is not just thoughtful or kind or caring, it's the feeling loved and loving that feeling. \"It was here where I learned the real definition of family.\"\n\nTEACHER FEEDBACK: The essay provides a warm and heartfelt narrative of the author's family life, emphasizing the values of courage, love, and community. However, it lacks a clear and original thesis statement, which makes it challenging to grasp the central argument or unique perspective the writer aims to convey. The essay wanders at times, leading to a sense of disjointedness, especially in how the introduction and body paragraphs transition. The vocabulary is varied, but there are notable grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures that detract from the overall flow and coherence. While the narrative is somewhat engaging, it could benefit from more strategic use of transitional phrases to create a smoother reading experience. Additionally, while the memoir's essence is captured, more specific and consistent evidence from the provided excerpt would strengthen the arguments and maintain focus throughout the essay. Overall, the essay demonstrates potential but requires more refinement in structure, clarity, and adherence to the provided prompt.\n\n----- ESSAY CONTEXT -----\nHere is context on the essay assignment. Use this to provide feedback that is relevant to the essay assignment.\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt 5 Source.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Narciso Rodriguez \nfrom Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives \nMy parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a \nfurnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old \nNarciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon \ncall home. \nIn 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the \nIronbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our \ntraditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared \ncooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking \nthat is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which \nI adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of \nchildhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed \nboth, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. \nGrowing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \u201cfamily\u201d had nothing to do with \nbeing a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, \nCuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation \nprevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these \ncultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of \nhonest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their \nown kind, were clearly in need. \nOur landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and \nAlegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio \nand Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not \nknow my \u201creal\u201d grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were \nallowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and \nRosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family \nmembers came and went \u2014 and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they \nwere able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the \nmany people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. \nMy mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the \nlanguage or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a \nbetter life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country \nthey loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters \nwhile yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were \nstrong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind \nof jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had \nstudied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, \ntaking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their \nchildren to better times drove them to endure these hard times. \nI will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I\u2019ve often told them that what \nthey did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I\u2019ve often told them of \nmy admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I\u2019ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in \nreality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at \nsuch an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two \nlessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these \nteachings have been the basis of my life. \nIt was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to \nthis country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this \nhumble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not \njust scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of \u201cfamily.\u201d \nAnd for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I \nlearned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into \na home. \n\n\n======= ESSAY CONTEXT =======\nDOCUMENT NAME: Prompt-5-Guidelines.pdf\nDOCUMENT CONTENT: Prompt 5 \nPrompt \nThis essay is dependent on the source text. \nDescribe the mood created by the author in the memoir.
